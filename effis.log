Abstract 
The information on the causes of forest fires is of paramount importance to support the 
environmental and civil protection policies and design appropriate prevention measure.  
At  the  European  level  a  simple  common  scheme  with  4  fire  causes  classes  (deliberate, 
accident/negligence, natural and unknown) has been used to  record information on fire 
causes since 1992. 
European  countries  use  national  schemes  which  in  most  cases  are  much  more  detailed 
than  the  simple  4  common  classes,  but  they  are  not  harmonized  and  detailed  cross 
country comparisons are difficult. 
The  need  for  a  new  EU  scheme,  more  detailed  than  the  4  basic  categories  and 
harmonized  across  European  countries,  to  be  recorded  in  the  Fire  Database  of  the 
European  Forest  Fire  Information  System  (EFFIS),  has  been  identified  to  improve  the 
information level and the common knowledge on the origin of forest fires in Europe. 
The  new  scheme  has  been  conceived  to  be  applicable  with  limited  changes  to  the 
previous  country  settings,  preserving  as  much  as  possible  the  historical  data  series  of 
each country and exploiting at the same time as much as possible the level of detail of 
the information available.  
This  report  provides  a  detailed  description  of  the  new  scheme,  its  main  features  with 
precise definition of each cause class and the mapping of the historical national systems 
to the new harmonized system.  
The  scheme  is  hierarchical  and  is  made  of  29  fire  cause  classes,  8  groups  and  6 
categories. The explicit statement on the level of certainty in the attribution of the cause 
to a fire event has been introduced as a key element in the new scheme. 
This  harmonized  fire  cause  classification  scheme  is  expected  to  be  adopted  by  the 
countries  participating  to  the  EFFIS  network  in  the  coming  years,  and  therefore  be 
recorded  in  the  European  Fire  Database,  with  a  significant  added  value  for  the 
knowledge about the origin of forest fires in Europe.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
1. Background and scope 
The  European  Forest  Fire  Information  System  (EFFIS)  has  been  established 
jointly  by  the  European  Commission  (EC)  services  Directorate  General  for 
Environment and Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the relevant fires services  in 
the EU Member States and European countries.  
EFFIS  is  the  EC  focal  point  of  information  on  forest  fires  aiming  to  support  the 
national services in charge of the protection of forests against fires in the EU and 
neighbouring  countries,  and  also  to  provide  the  EC  services  such  as  the 
Monitoring  and  Information  Centre  (MIC)  of  Civil  Protection  and  the  European 
Parliament with up to date and harmonized information on forest fires in Europe. 
Research activities for the development of the system initiated in 1998 and the 
first  EFFIS  operations  were  in  the  year  2000.  In  2003,  EFFIS  was  officially 
established in the context of Forest Focus Regulation1. An EC Group of Expert on 
Forest  Fires  was  established,  with  representatives  from  the  EC  and  national 
services  that  meet  regularly  to  work  jointly  on  EFFIS  and  share  information  on 
forest fires in Europe.  
A key component of EFFIS is the European Fire Database, containing forest fire 
information  compiled  by  countries  members  of  the  EFFIS  network.  Fire  data 
provided each year by national authorities are checked, stored and managed by 
JRC  within  the  fire  database.  The  database  stores  key  information  on  location, 
time,  size  and  cause  of  over  2  million  individual  fire  events,  recorded  in  22 
European countries over the last 8 to 32 years (depending on country). 
The  first  steps  to  create  a  common  forest  fire  database  in  Europe  were  taken 
under the Regulation 2158/922 (now expired), which set up an action framework 
focussing  mainly  on  measures  for  the  prevention  of  forest  fires.  Under  this 
regulation,  a  first  forest  fire  information  system,  referred  to  as  the  Common 
Core  Database,  was  established  in  order  to  collect  information  on  forest  fires, 
their  causes  and  to  improve  the  understanding  of  forest  fires  and  their 
prevention. After Forest Focus Regulation  of 2003, the Common Core Database 
was transferred to the EFFIS. Handed over to and further developed by the JRC 
it was re-named the European Fire Database. 
The  European  Parliament  (EP)  in  its  resolution  of  September  20063 noted  that, 
despite  the  fact  that  the  EFFIS  had  managed  to  harmonize  data  on  fires  within 
Member States and to provide updated information on the natural risk factors, it 
did  not  permit  investigation  of  the  anthropogenic  origins,  did  not  determine 
socioeconomic  risk  factors  and  did  not  evaluate  the  repercussions  of  fires.  The 
EP therefore called on the European Commission to submit a proposal to correct 
these shortcomings.

November  2003  concerning  monitoring  of  forests  and  environmental interactions  in  the 
Community (Forest Focus).

forests against fire

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
Following the EP recommendations, the further development of EFFIS has been 
ensured through a grant from the European Parliament on forest protection and 
conservation.  In  this  context  a  tender  was  launched  by  JRC  in  2008  and  a 
service  contract  was  awarded  to  a  consortium 4 with  the  aim  of  developing  a 
common framework for harmonized classification and reporting on fire causes in 
Europe and the definition of main factors affecting fire occurrence in the different 
European regions. 
Among  the  outcome  of  the  study  there  has  been  a  proposal 5  of  a  common 
classification  scheme  of  fire  causes  to  be  submitted  and  discussed  for  adoption 
by  the  Member  States.  Thus,  as  a  follow  up  of  the  study,  the  classification 
scheme has been presented and discussed in various meetings of the EC Expert 
Group on Forest Fires, where the main national forest fire management services 
of the European countries are represented.  
After  some  amendments  to  the  initial  proposal,  a  harmonized  classification 
scheme of fire causes has been accepted in  2012 for adoption  by the countries 
as  a  common  mean  to  record  fire  causes  when  reporting  national  data  to  the 
European Fire Database.  
This  report  intends  to  summarize  the  rationale  and  provide  a  in  depth 
description of the harmonized scheme for fire causes reporting in Europe. 
2. EU level fire causes reporting requirements 
The  information  on  the  causes  of  forest  fires  is  of  paramount  importance  to 
support  the  environmental  and  civil  protection  policies  and  design  appropriate 
prevention measure.  
the 
following 
European countries use national schemes for classifying forest fire causes. In the 
Common  Core  fire  database  a  simple  common  EU  scheme  was  adopted  which 
considered 
fire  causes:  deliberate, 
four  categories  of 
accident/negligence,  natural  and  unknown.  The  European  Fire  Database  of 
EFFIS, which has taken over the Common Core fire database, stores both the EU 
scheme and the national cause categories. The latter in most countries are much 
more detailed than the simple 4 EU categories, but they are not harmonized and 
detailed comparisons are difficult. 
Hence the need of a new EU scheme, more detailed than the 4 basic categories 
and  harmonized  across  European  countries,  has  been  identified  to  improve  the

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
information  level  and  the  common  knowledge  on  the  origin  of  forest  fires  in 
Europe. 
The new scheme has been conceived to be applicable with limited changes to the 
previous  country  settings,  preserving  as  much  as  possible  the  historical  data 
series of each country and exploiting at the same time as much as possible the 
level  of  detail  of  the  information  available.  A  mapping  of  the  historical  national 
systems to the new harmonized system was also realized to the possible extent. 
Because  the  level  of  detail  of  classified  fire  causes  is  quite  varied  among 
countries, and the causes of forest fires may also differ significantly, the system 
has  been  designed  in  a  hierarchical  way,  providing  in  this  way  some  flexibility 
and facilitating the mapping of the different systems currently used in Europe to 
the common scheme. 
A key feature of the new scheme is that common fire causes categories have to 
be widely agreed/recognized;  in addition clear and unambiguous definitions are 
integral part of the new classification scheme. 
Identifying  the  origin  and  cause  of  a  forest  fire  is  not  easy;  it  is  not  always 
possible and implies in all cases significant efforts and skill. Certain causes may 
also  have  legal  implications  within  the  country,  with  additional  complications 
when  responsibilities  have  to  be  identified.  The  harmonized  fire  causes 
classification  scheme  for  EU  is  aimed  to  enhance  reporting  for  statistical  and 
scientific purposes, thus it is not related to legal responsibility and prosecution.  
Nevertheless a key feature that has been introduced in the scheme is the explicit 
statement  of  the  confidence  level  of  the  knowledge  of  a  fire  cause  and  the 
exclusion of any purely “guessed” fire cause. In the new scheme it is requested 
that  the  cause  of  a  fire  is  reported  only  if  targeted  investigations  have  been 
carried  out;  the  cause  is  qualified  as  “certain”  only  if,  after  investigation,  the 
ignition point of the fire has been found and the cause has been identified with 
no doubts. More details are provided in the following section.

3. The new European fire causes classification scheme  
In  the  new  European  fire  cause  classification  scheme,  the  cause  of  each  fire 
event has to be reported with 2 entries (fields):  
a) Certainty of knowledge of the fire cause 
b) The fire cause category 
3.1. Certainty of knowledge of the fire cause 
The new scheme is based on the objective assessment of the fire cause through 
dedicated  investigations  which  entail  the  identification  of  the  point  of  origin  of 
the fire (ignition point).  
If the point of ignition is detected (and possibly also the ignition device), the fire 
cause  might  be  identified  and  reported  in  the  database  as  certain  (however  in 
some  cases,  even  with  known  point  of  ignition,  the  cause  cannot  be  identified 
and  remains  unknown).  If  not,  the  fire  cause  is  to  be  reported  as  either 
uncertain or unknown.  
If the point of ignition cannot be precisely specified remaining vaguely identified 
while  different  elements  from  the  investigation  support  specific  assumptions 
about the fire cause, then the fire cause can be reported as uncertain. 
If  the  point  of  ignition  is  not  detected,  the  fire  cause  is  to  be  reported  in  the 
database as unknown.   
A summary of the above is given with the diagram in Figure 1, which illustrates 
a dichotomous key to assess the level of certainty in the identification of the fire 
causes to be reported in the fire database.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
The  possible  entries  in  the  database  item  “certainty  of  knowledge”  are  the 
following: 
Code 
1
2
3
4
5
Description  
Information not given (level of certainty not specified) 
Cause  not  investigated  (unknown  because  investigation 
not carried out) 
Cause not found (unknown because investigation carried 
out but cause not found) 
Cause  uncertain  (point  of  origin  not  found  precisely  or 
cause  assumed  after  a  number  of  different  elements 
from the investigation) 
Cause certain (point of origin found and cause positively 
determined after investigation) 
Code  1  is  the  default,  and  it  is  used  when  the  information  on  the  level  of 
certainty is not provided. Codes 2 and 3 are variations of “unknown”.  
3.2. Fire causes classes, groups and categories 
The new fire causes classification scheme has 3 hierarchical levels.  
At  the  level  with  higher  detail  there  are  29  fire  cause  classes,  organized  into  8 
groups which in turns correspond to 6 generic categories.  
The 6 categories of the upper level are similar to the former “Common Core” EU 
scheme and are the following: 
1. Unknown 
2. Natural 
3. Accident 
4. Negligence 
5. Deliberate 
6. Rekindle 
In this new scheme the former accident/negligence cause has been split into two 
categories  and  a  new  generic  category  “Rekindle”  for  restarting  fires  has  been 
introduced. 
Within  each  category,  different  groups  and  classes  define  the  lower  2  levels  of 
the  classification.  Table  1  shows  the  complete  list  of  classes,  groups  and 
categories of the new scheme.  The numerical code of each item is also given in 
the table. 
The precise description of each class is given in section 4.

4. Definitions of individual fire cause classes, groups and 
categories 
In what follows definitions of each fire causes category, group and class are given, with 
the corresponding numerical codes.  
100 UNKNOWN 
Wildfire with no cause found. 
200 NATURAL  
Any wildfire caused by natural origin, with no human involvement in any way. 
201 Lightning 
Wildfire caused directly or indirectly by lightning. 
202 Volcanism 
Wildfire caused by volcanism. 
203 Gas emission 
Wildfire  caused by natural emissions of gas (e.g. coming from peat bog) that can 
self-ignite. 
300 ACCIDENT 
Wildfire  unintentionally  and  indirectly  caused  by  human  without  use  of  fire,  connected 
neither to will nor to negligence rather to fatality.  
301 Electrical power 
Wildfire  caused  by  sparks  due  to  failure  of  electric  lines  or  other  electric  wirings: 
short-circuits  due  to  contact  between  two  lines  or  between  line  and  vegetation  or 
bird, fall of the line, etc. 
302 Railroads (Railways) 
Wildfire caused by sparks emitted by train brakes or fall of catenaries. It has to be 
linked  with  the  operation  of  trains.  Fires  lit  intentionally  or  not  by  passengers  or 
railway  employees  (by  smoking,  managing  vegetation,  etc.)  are  not  classified  in 
this  category  and  have  to  be  classified  in  the  category  corresponding  to  “what 
these persons did” to set the fire (and not to “where they were”). 
303 Vehicles 
Wildfire  caused  by  exhausts  (expulsion  of  glowing  carbon  deposits,  hot  catalytic 
converter)  and  brakes  of  vehicles  travelling  along  the  road,  or  by  road  incidents 
(burning motor for example) or traffic accidents 
304 Works 
Wildfire caused by sparks emitted by engines and machinery (such as chainsaw) in 
industry, forestry and agriculture or people at work (explosions, welding, grinding, 
smouldering)  or  by  ignition  of  flammables  and  vapours  during  works  in  industrial 
activities. 
11 
Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
305 Weapons (firearms, explosives, etc.) 
Wildfire caused either by military exercises (firing, explosions) or by citizens using 
firearms  (in  hunting  activities  for  instance)  or  explosion  due  to  explosives  during 
works.  This  class  takes  also  into  account  the  fires  set  after  explosions  due  to 
ammunitions from I and II World Wars buried underground. 
306 Self-ignition (auto-combustion)  
Wildfire  caused  by  self-ignition  of  vegetation  wastes  and  other  products  left  in 
piles. 
307 Other accident 
Wildfire  caused  by  other  accidental  cause  (Other  technical  incidents)  than  those 
previously  defined.  In  this  class  are  coded  the  wildfires  due  to  “Sun”  because  the 
sun alone does not allow the ignition but needs an object like a piece of glass. Also 
included  are  causes  such  as  “Glass”,  “Friction  energy”,  “thermal  reaction  of 
chemicals” or “Self-ignition of coal”. 
400 NEGLIGENCE 
Wildfire unintentionally caused by human using fire or glowing object, not connected to 
fatality  
410 Use of fire 
Wildfire unintentionally set by people making fire especially for cleaning or recreation. 
The  difference  between  “deliberate”  and  this  category  is  that  the  fire  is  initially 
voluntarily set for a specific purpose and not in order to destroy the natural area. To 
be classified in this category, the fire has to escape and get out of control.   
411 Vegetation management 
Wildfire  caused  by  any  kind  of  vegetation  burnings  for  private,  forestry,  pastoral 
(pasture  regeneration)  purposes  including  prescribed  burnings,  burning  of  slashes 
or of piles of vegetal waste but except for agricultural purposes. 
412 Agricultural burnings 
Wildfire caused by all types of agricultural burnings (stubble burnings, etc.). 
413 Waste management 
Wildfire caused by garbage burnings in official or illegal dumps (dunghill) including 
private, industrial and commercial. 
414 Recreation 
Wildfire  caused  by  people  engaged  in  a  recreational  activity  (vacationing,  fishing, 
picnicking,  non-commercial  berry  picking,  hiking,  and  hunting)  setting  barbecues, 
bonfires and campfires of any kind (for cooking, heating, etc). 
415 Other negligent use of fire 
Wildfire caused by other use of fire than those previously defined. In this class are 
coded the wildfires due to “bonfires at work” “facility fires” and “Candles”. 
420 Use of glowing objects 
Wildfire unintentionally set by people using glowing objects such as (i) fireworks, (ii) 
cigarettes, (iii) hot ash handling by residents or (iv) during working activities such as 
apiculture, fumigation or disinfection or when expulsion of firebrands out of chimney. 
421 Fireworks, firecrackers and distress flares 
Wildfire  caused  by  fireworks  with  or  without  preventive  measures,  by  firecrackers 
and by distress flares regardless of who lit it. 
12 
Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
422 Cigarettes 
Wildfire  caused  by  cigarettes  and  tobacco  pipe  regardless  of  the  activity  or  the 
location of the smoker. It includes the fires set by the match used for lighting the 
cigarette  and  negligently  thrown  away  by  the  smoker,  but  not  cases  where  a 
cigarette or matches have been used to set an arson fire. 
423 Hot ashes 
Wildfire caused by hot ash handling by people after a barbecue or a fire. This class 
is  related  to  recreational  activities.  Hot  ashes  related  to  work  are  classified in  the 
following class. 
424 Other use of glowing object 
Wildfire  caused  by  other  use  of  glowing  object  than  those  previously  defined.  In 
this  class  are  coded  wildfires  due  to  working  activities  such  as  apiculture, 
fumigation  or  disinfection  or  due  to  glowing  firebrands  expulsed  out  of  chimneys 
regardless of the building. 
500 DELIBERATE (synonyms: intentional, voluntary)  
Wildfire intentionally caused by human with the use of fire. 
510 Responsible (arson) 
Wildfire  wilfully  ignited  by  people  over  the  legal  age,  which  burns  or  spreads  to 
vegetation or property without consent of the owner.   
511 Interest (profit) 
Wildfire  set  for  profit,  either  directly  for  monetary  gain  or  from  a  goal  other  than 
money: 
inventory, 
employment,  parcel  clearance,  competition  for  agricultural,  forestry,  hunting  and 
pastoral  purposes  to  frighten  wildlife,  to  get  a  job  in  the  fire  fighting  area,  to 
change land-uses or to get a better salary as fire-fighter, etc. 
liquidate  property,  dissolve  business, 
insurance, 
fraud, 
512 Conflict (revenge) 
Wildfire set in retaliation for real or perceived injustice or wrong: 
- Personal revenge: (to retaliate for a one-to one or personal grievance, argument, 
fight, personal affront or any of infinite arrays of events perceived by the offender 
to warrant retaliation). 
- Societal retaliation: (in revenge against the society that the author perceives has 
wronged him). 
- Institutional: (fire against institutions or use of fire to settle grievances with the 
institution and to intimidate those associated with the institution). 
- Group retaliation: (fire as expression of anger towards the group or its members 
rather than anger at a specific individual within the group). 
- Intimidation. 
513 Vandalism 
Malicious or mischievous fire setting that results in damage to property: wilful and 
malicious mischief or peer group pressure. 
514 Excitement (incendiary) 
Wildfires set to gain attention and to meet the needs  of being important. Seeking 
of  thrill,  attention,  recognition,  relief  of  boredom.  Includes  fires  lit  in  order  to 
admire the spectacle of extinguishing means. 
515 Crime concealment 
Wildfire set to hide or conceal the primary crime activity: murder, suicide, breaking 
and entering, embezzlement, larceny, destroying records. Fires set as diversionary 
tactic fall into this category. 
13 
Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
516 Extremist 
Wildfire set to further social, political or religious causes: terrorism, discrimination, 
riots/civil disturbance. 
520 Irresponsible 
Wildfire caused by people not responsible for their actions because under legal age or 
mentally ill. 
521 Mental illness 
Wildfire caused by people in case of pyromania or other mental illnesses. 
522 Children 
Wildfire set by children (under legal age) for game or entertainment. 
600 REKINDLE 
Wildfire caused by re-ignition of a previous fire, due to latent heat or embers. 
5. Conversion of historical fire data of the European Fire 
Database  
The new scheme should be adopted by the countries participating to the EFFIS network 
in the coming years. To ensure the continuity of the historical records, a conversion from 
the  current  country  schemes  to  the  new  European  scheme  has  been  carried  out  in  the 
European Fire Database.  
In  the  Appendix  the  mapping  adopted 
for  each  country,  and  therefore  the 
correspondence between the European and the country scheme, is detailed together with 
the main results of the conversion made. 
It  is  inevitable  that  there  is  not  an  exact  1:1  correspondence  between  every  country 
cause category and the new codes. In some cases  the country codes could be assigned 
to  more  than  one  of  the  new  EU  codes.  In  other  cases  the  country  codes  made  a 
distinction that is not present in the EU codes. 
In  cases  where  one  local  cause  could  be  mapped  to  several  possible  new  causes,  the 
most likely cause was chosen and used in all cases for historical data.  
In cases where several local causes mapped to a single new cause, the conversion  was 
simpler.  The  original  country  cause  was  also  retained  in  the  database  to  keep  all  the 
information available about the fire.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6. APPENDIX – Mapping of the country systems to the 
new European system 
In  what  follows  results  of  the  conversion  of  historical  fire  data  of  the  European  Fire 
Database are detailed for each country in the database.  
Due  to  the  semantic  uncertainty  in  the  conversion  of  some  cause  classes,  a  number  of 
special codes were introduced for the conversion of historical fire data.  
Most  of  these  are  variations  of  the  “unknown”  category,  allowing  the  fire  causes  to  be 
distinguished  between  those  cases  where  an  investigation  was  made  and  no  known 
cause was found, and those where for some other reason the fire cause (which might be 
known) could not be properly elaborated.  
These codes are detailed in the table below. 
Code value 
1000 
1001 
1002 
1003 
1004 
Rationale 
No  information  (cause  might  have  been  known  but  was  never 
given) 
No  country  code,  and  old  EU  code  3  –  either  accident  or 
negligence but no way to determine which 
No country code and invalid EU code (not 1-4) 
Country  code  given  without  description  –  impossible  to  tell  what 
the cause was 
Country cause code given as “other known reason” (i.e. reason is 
known but not specified) 
It  is  hoped  that  these  special  codes  will  be  rarely  used  for  the  future,  as  the  new 
European codes will be adopted.

The  country  cause  scheme  is  a  non-hierarchical  list  of  17  causes.  The  country  codes 
were  mapped  to  the  new  scheme  and  records  stored  in  the  European  Fire  Database 
(2005-2010) were converted as shown in Table 2.

Notes 
\uf0b7 The  category  “Hunters”  is  now  split  into  3  possible  new  cause  categories  depending 
on  the  motivation  of  the  hunters:  411  if  it  is  to  burn  the  vegetation  to  facilitate 
hunting;  511  if  for  interest  and  512  if  as  a  result  of  conflict.  For  conversion  of  the 
historical data, where motivation is unknown, the cause 511 (Interest) was chosen as 
the most likely reason. This affects only 4 fires in the database. 
\uf0b7 “Transport/technological  sparks”  could  be  302  (Railroads),  303  (Vehicles),  304 
(Works)  or  307  (Other  accident).  Since  these  causes  all  come  under  the  first  level 
category  Accident,  the  46  fires  in  the  database  with  this  cause  were  coded  300 
(Accident). 
\uf0b7 “Workers  at  Open  Air”  could  be  304  (Works)  or  411  (Vegetation  Management).  The 
53 fires in this category were assigned the code 411, as the most likely cause. 
\uf0b7 For all the other fires there was a 1:1 correspondence between the national and new 
causes.  
\uf0b7 “Military  shooting”  and  “Explosion  works”  are  merged  into  the  new  category  305 
(Weapons). No fires had been assigned to Explosion works in the Bulgarian data.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6.7. France 
From  1985  to  2007  only  the  4  original  EU  classifications  (Unknown,  Natural, 
Accident/Negligence, Deliberate) were included in the fire data. However,  for some fires 
from  15  departments  in  the  Mediterranean  occurring  between  1998  and  2009,  detailed 
cause  codes  from  the  Prometheus  database  were  also  given.  From  2007  a  16  point 
national  code  was  used  to  describe  all  the  fires.  The  translations  of  these  systems  into 
the new EU fire cause codes are shown below in Table 9, Table 10 and Table 11.

more  than  one  code  depending  on  the  object  thrown,  so  the  less  precise  code  420 
(use of glowing object) had to be used.
\uf0b7 The  national  code  FR_3.9  “leisure  activities”  could  be  given  more  than  one  code 
depending on context. In this case 414 (Recreation) was chosen to be the most likely 
case for the 146 fires concerned.
\uf0b7 Code  412  (Agricultural  burnings)  was  chosen  as  the  most  likely  cause  for  the  split 
category FR_3.6 “agricultural works”.
\uf0b7 Code 411 (vegetation management) was chosen as the most likely cause for the two 
split codes FR_3.5 “forest works” and FR_3.8 “private works”.
\uf0b7 Code 340 (Works) was assigned to FR_3.7 “industrial or crafts works”.

No local fire cause codes are supplied with the data; only the 4 EU categories (Unknown, 
Natural,  Accident/Negligence,  Deliberate)  are  supplied.  For  some  years  an  extra 
category “Other human cause (e.g. Military)” was used. These were assigned new cause 
codes as shown in Table 12.

\uf0b7 The  national  cause  code  “Naked  light”  has  been  split  into  2  new  cause  codes 
depending on whether the fire was started deliberately or not: 415 (Other use of fire) 
for negligent use and 500 (Voluntary) for deliberate use of naked light. The Hungarian 
data also included the old 4-point EU codes which allowed the fires classified with the 
national cause code “Naked light” to be split into the two new codes.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6.11. Italy 
The Italian fire data have a long time-series, and several coding systems have been used 
in the past to describe fire causes. The current national system is a 40 point scale. From 
2002 the fires have been coded according to these cause categories. The mapping of the 
national codes with the new cause categories is shown in Table 16. 
For  all  the  fires  occurring  before  2002,  the  different  cause  schemes  were  allocated  to 
new cause codes as appropriate.

cause  was  “other”  or  “military  activities”.  The  fires  already  recorded  in  this  split 
category were all assigned code 350 in the absence of more information. This affected 
only 5 fires in the database.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6.14. Poland 
Before  2007,  the  State  Fire  Services  codes  were  used  to  describe  fire  causes.  This  is a 
37-point code, covering not only forest fires. Many of the detailed cause categories were 
therefore  merged,  as  they  did  not  relate  specifically  to  forests.  From  2007,  the  data 
included additional fires that came from the State Forests and National Parks database, 
which  uses  a  different  set  of  cause  codes  (13  classes).  The  translation  of  these  two 
systems into the new EU cause codes are shown in Table 19 and Table 20.

matches”  was  split  into  2  new  cause  categories:  414  (Recreation)  and  422 
(Cigarettes). The category considered most likely (414) was assigned to the historical 
data. 
\uf0b7 Codes  PSP-36  (Other  Causes)  and  LP-12  (Other  including  military  exercises)  were 
assigned the special code 1004 (Reason known but not specified). 
\uf0b7 The historic fires in split code LP3 “Other carelessness of adults” were assigned to the 
new cause 304 (Works) as the most likely cause. 
\uf0b7 The  historic  fires  in  split  code  LP-1  “Tourism  and  picking  fruits  of  the  forest”  were 
assigned to the new cause 414 (Recreation) as the most likely cause.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6.15. Portugal 
Since  2001  Portugal  has  used  a  3-level  hierarchical  system  for  classifying  fire  causes. 
This  is  translated  into  the  new  EU  system  as  shown  in  Table  21  below.  For  those  fires 
occurring before 2001 a variety of old coding systems were used. These were examined 
individually and an appropriate code was assigned.

6.16. Romania 
In Romania, currently there is no classification by codes of presumed forest fire causes. 
The  Fire  Department  uses  nominal  lists  for  presumed  fire  causes,  and  a  detailed 
classification  of  forest  fire  presumed  causes  and  codes  is  under  construction.  The  fire 
causes  found  in  the  fire  data  from  2004-2010  were  mapped  to  the  new  scheme  as 
shown in Table 22.

translated into the new EU fire cause code scheme, in case any of the codes are used in 
the future (Table 24).

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
Notes  
\uf0b7 For  conversion  of  the  historical  data,  the  special  code  1001  was  used  for  code  1.12 
(“Negligence”) as this category actually contains both accidental and negligence fires 
(similar  to  old  EU  code  3)  and  the  precise  cause  cannot  be  determined.  For  future 
data the fires should be able to be split into either 300 (accident) or 400 (negligence). 
The same special code was also used for “Other (army etc)” for the same reason.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6.19. Spain 
The Spanish codes for fire causes is a hierarchical scheme with 65 causes listed. Like the 
new  EU  scheme  it  is  possible  to  specify  more  or  less  information  about  the  cause. 
However, for the data  sent to the  European  fire database, the deliberately started fires 
(codes 4nn) are only specified to the first level of detail and the motivation is therefore 
unknown.

\uf0b7 The Swedish code “Fire spread when burning other things than grass” has been split 
into  several  possible  new  cause  codes  depending  on  the  activity:  411  if  primarily  to 
control vegetation; 413 if waste management and 415 (other use of fire) if neither of 
these.  For  converting  the  historical  data  the  code  411  was  used,  as  the  most  likely 
possibility. This affects 2215 fires in the database. 
\uf0b7 The 4689 fires given the national code “Other” were assigned the special code 1004.

Harmonized classification scheme of fire causes in the EU 
6.21. Switzerland 
The Swiss nation scheme comprises a 15 point code. Some of the codes (e.g. “forestry”) 
could be mapped to several possibilities in the new scheme. These are  split and for the 
future, the most appropriate classification can be selected according to the detail of the 
cause as shown in Table 27.

\uf0b7 The national code 12 “Other technical systems: includes problems on motor vehicles” 
was split into new cause codes 303 (Vehicles) for accidents involving vehicles and 307 
(other  accident)  for  general  accidents.  No  fires  in  the  historic  data  were  registered 
under this code. 
\uf0b7 The  national  code  7  “Forestry”  was  split into  411  (Vegetation  management)  and  the 
general code 204 (Works). For the historic data, code 411 was used as the most likely 
cause. 
\uf0b7 The  national  code  8  “Agriculture”  was  split  into  412  (Agricultural  burnings)  and  the 
general code 204 (Works). For the historic data, code 412 was used as the most likely 
cause. 
\uf0b7 The  national  code  5  “Private”  was  split  into  422  (Cigarettes),  414  (Recreation)  and 
the  general  code  400  (Negligence).  For  the  historic  data,  code  422  was  used  as  the 
most likely cause.

\uf0b7 The  national  code  9  “Other  (intention-accident)”  had  to  be  coded  as  1004  (Reason 
known but not specified) as there was not enough information to be more precise. 
\uf0b7 National  codes  4  “Swaddle”  and  5  “Exposure”  were  combined  into  the  new  cause 
category 307 (Other accident). 
\uf0b7 National codes 12 “Hunting”, 13 “Shepherd fire” and 14 “Picnic fire” were merged into 
the new cause code 414 (Recreation) after consultation with the Turkish fire experts. 
\uf0b7 2 fires were given a code of 19, for which there is no explanation, and were given the 
special code 1003.
