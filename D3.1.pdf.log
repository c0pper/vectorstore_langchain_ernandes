 DELIVERABLE INFORMATION 
 Deliverable Number: 
 3.1 
 Deliverable Name: 
 SILVANUS First report on the formal specification of sustainable 
 and resilient forest management knowledge model 
 Dissemination level: 
 Type of Document: 
 PU 
 Contractual date of delivery:  29/09/2022 
 Date of submission: 
 29/09/2022 
 Deliverable Leader: 
 EAI 
 Status: 
 Final draft  
 Version number: 
 V0.3 
 WP Leader/ Task Leader: 
 WP3 – SIMAVI / T3.1 – EAI 
 Keywords: 
 Abstract: 
 Collection,  Concept,  Data, 
 Inference  based 
 reasoning, 
 Knowledge management, Ontology, Relation, Taxonomy 
 This  deliverable  is  divided  in  three  parts.  First,  we  provide  an 
 overview  of  the  state  of  the  art  for  knowledge  and  ontologies 
 related to the SILVANUS field of operation. Then we proceeded 
 the  most  appropriate  resources  and 
 to  pick  and  choose 
 methodologies for our goals. Finally, we describe the ontology that 
 resulted from task 3.1 activity. 
 The ontology that is used by a system is the actual backbone of 
 the information that the system collects, processes, and produces. 
 However, based on the research performed in this work package 
 we noticed that important pieces of environmental and other 
 types of information that should be collected were not included in 
 state-of-the-art ontologies. Therefore, they were significantly 
 extended and enriched with many “fields” that are necessary 
 when performing inference on data collected from a vast array of 
 sources.
