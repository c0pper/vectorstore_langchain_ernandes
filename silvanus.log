Role in the project \u202f 
\uf0b7 WP1: Z&P will lead the scientific coordination of SILVANUS and will bridge the end -user requirements to the 
technical partners. Z&P will be responsible for monitoring the technical progress acehived within the project 
and will closely collaborate with th e technical partrners in the consortium.  
\uf0b7 WP2: Z&P will contribute to the participatory process setup by TUZVO and will further facililate the formali-
zation of functional requirements.  
\uf0b7 WP7: The project outcomes will be formally published by the consortium  with contributions from Z&P. The 
success of techonoogy intervention validated by stakeholders (resulting from WP9) outcomes will be promoted 
across the community.  
\uf0b7 WP9: Z&P will monitor and oversee the preparation readiness of each pilot organization. Z&P  will also partici-
pate in the formal evaluation of the demonstration outcome.  
\uf0b7 WP10: Z&P will contribute to the dissemination and exploitation of the SILVANUS results.

101037247  – SILVANUS – Part B  
 3 Implementation  
3.1 Work Plan – Work Packages, Deliverables and Milestones  
The SILVANUS workpl an 
extends 42 months and the 
activities of the project are 
clustered into 10 work-
packages for addressing 
the all the phases (A, B and 
C) of the project.  The inter-
dependency of the project 
activities is outlined in  Fig-
ure 15. The te chnical activ-
ities of the project are 
grouped into four (4) main 
thematic structures, with 
WP2 focussed on the ag-
gregation and consolida-
tion of functional require-
ments of SILVANUS plat-
form. The output of WP2 
will be fed into the devel-
opment of Phase A and B 
activities carried out in 
WP3, WP4 and WP5. The 
planning, preparedness and citizen engagement activities are grouped into WP3 (Phase A). Subsequently, the ad-
vanced detection and response coordination activities are grouped into WP4 and WP5. The post reha bilitation activ-
ities on forest restoration is carried out in WP6, followed by the development of policy recommendations in WP7. 
The overall platform integration is carried out in WP8, while the large -scale demonstration activities are carried out 
in WP9. The overall project lifecycle is structured into two main sprint cycles. The demonstration activities are 
carried out from M12 to M42 as outlined in Section 1.3.2. The project activities will be continuously disseminated 
and communicated within the communi ty of interdisciplinary stakeholders. The project gantt chart is also presented.

101037247  – SILVANUS – Part B  
 3.2.3  Project Meetings  
The projec t partners will meet on a regular basis as envisaged in the table  below . To guarantee a smoother and more 
efficient start -up of the project, the first meetings will be organised in person, to foster expedited development of the 
SILVANUS  scientific framewor k. The following meetings are planned within the duration of the project lifespan:  
Meeting purpose  Estimated date  Host (Partner)  
General assembly  Every 6 months  Z&P, TUZVO, SIMAVI, CMCC  F, DELL, AUA, ASFOR  
Remote teleconference  Monthly  Z&P  
 
The above me etings will be co -located with each other to reduce the overheads and in addition to the above meetings, 
regular meetings using teleconferencing systems will be further used. Also, additional meetings will be called as and 
when necessary based on the unani mous consensus of the steering board members.  
3.2.4  Quality monitoring  
The project management system will be defined in D1.1, which will be the top document for project management 
purposes to ensure the best quality of results. The plan will set out the organis ation for project management and 
define the key criteria for planning and control of the technical work, the budget and the programme. This manage-
ment handbook will be practical guideline to facilitate the management of the project for all participants. It  will detail 
and explain all contractual rules and management procedures. It will provide useful advice and management tools, 
which will help project participants to do what is required in due form and in due time. The following table summa-
rised the major milestones which will be used to evaluate the success of SILVANUS . 
 
3.3 Consortium as a Whole  
The SILVANUS consortium consists of 50 partners 
from 18 countries as presented in  Figure 19. All part-
ners have exemplary track record of hi gh-impact inno-
vation in technical and scientific research required to 
achieve the project objectives. The composition of the 
consortium has been considered to offer complemen-
tary skill sets among the partners to collaboratively de-
velop the environmentally sustainable forest manage-
ment platform. The various scenarios developed for 
modelling the cause of wildfire ignition and subsequent 
factors influencing the spread of the wildfire will be an-
alysed in detail across different pilot demonstration ac-
tivities pl anned within the project.  Complementary 
and role of partners . The SILVANUS consortium has 
been carefully selected to incorporate the necessary 
interdisciplinary expertise to complement the in-
dustrial strength to achieve the project objectives. The consorti um contains a broad scope of expertise and technical 
knowledge in the analysis of climate pattern, IoT devices and edge sensing, cloud computing, ecological and biodi-
versity resilience, fire suppression systems and big-data analytics. A detailed overview o f each partner specific con-
tribution to the workplan is outlined in Section 4.1  
 
3.4 Resources to be committed  
3.4.1  Other direct costs  
A total of 2.8% of project resources are allocated to the pilot demonstration owners  for equipment and consumables. 
In complementa ry, a total of 5.2% is allocated for travel to facilitate collaboration among national, European,  and 
International partners. Additionally, funding is also allocated to support the collaboration with advisory board mem-
bers representing eminent organisation s such as WWF -Brazil, leading experts on post -fire rehabilitation and forest 
conservation.  
P1. PEG ASO  Cost  Justification  
Travel  €60,000 Support for advisory board, GA, conferences,  and workshops

Figure 7 - SILVANUS pilot duration  
\uf0b7 In the requirements phase , the SILVANUS technical members will activel y engage with the stakeholder (WP2). 
A formal consolidation of forest landscape management tools and components will be identified. A functional 
requirement of the project platform will be drafted. Additionally, the architecture specification for the compo nent 
integration will be defined (WP8).  
\uf0b7 Sprint 1 : The first cycle will carry out the project’s technical activities. Each challenge outlined in the workpro-
gramme is uniquely addressed with each of the WPs. Phase A and B activities are carried out in WP3, W P4 and 
WP5. Phase C activities are carried out in WP6 and WP7. The outcome of the Sprint 1 will be evaluated through 
the demonstration activities carried out in WP9.  
\uf0b7 Sprint 2 : Following the initial feedback from the stakeholders on the effectiveness of pro ject platform in com-
bating against wildfires, the project will undertake continued innovation to achieve the technical objectives out-
lined in Table 1. Each of the outcome will be evaluated against the KPIs set forth in the list of s pecific objectives.  
\uf0b7 Exploitation : Represents the last phase of the project in which the commercial positioning of each project out-
come will be addressed. The outcome from the demonstration activities will be further utilised to identify the 
market niche a nd position the products developed in the project to be launched in the market. A detailed business 
plan for both individual components and joint exploitation agreement resulting from the collaboration will be 
reported.  
A more detailed timeline specificati on of each individual pilot duration is presented in Figure 7. Each demonstration 
activity includes a planning phase, trial phase and assessment phase, appropriately divided into each time period.  
1.3.2  SILVANUS  Validation and Pilots  
The project innovation carried out will be systematically 
demonstrated across eight (8) EU and three (3) non -EU sites. 
An overview of the locations in which the pilot activities are 
to take place is presented in Figure 8. The six (6 ) common 
causes of fire ignitions  will be assessed,  and dedicated scenar-
ios will be identified for the organisation of technological in-
tervention. In addition to the generic category, the causes 
listed in Table 2 will be considered . Each pilot demonstration 
is divided into three main periods namely (i) preparation and 
organisation;(ii) demonstration; and (iii) assessment evalua-
tion. To achieve the demonstration, the consortium has iden-
tified two organisation deployment to be carried  out within the 
consortium. An organisation deployment refers to the base in-
