Abstract: 
Collection,  Concept,  Data, 
Inference  based 
reasoning, 
Knowledge management, Ontology, Relation, Taxonomy 
This  deliverable  is  divided  in  three  parts.  First,  we  provide  an 
overview  of  the  state  of  the  art  for  knowledge  and  ontologies 
related to the SILVANUS field of operation. Then we proceeded 
the  most  appropriate  resources  and 
to  pick  and  choose 
methodologies for our goals. Finally, we describe the ontology that 
resulted from task 3.1 activity. 
3 
The ontology that is used by a system is the actual backbone of 
the information that the system collects, processes, and produces. 
However, based on the research performed in this work package 
we noticed that important pieces of environmental and other 
types of information that should be collected were not included in 
state-of-the-art ontologies. Therefore, they were significantly 
extended and enriched with many “fields” that are necessary 
when performing inference on data collected from a vast array of 
sources.

existing technologies and a bottom-up listening methodology that \nallowed for the identification of SILVANUS-specific ontology classes. \nAn  ontology  is  an  explicit  formal  description  of  concepts  that  make  up  a  single  domain  of \nknowledge.  For  example,  a  domain  describing  movies  may  include  the  concepts  of  actor,  crew, \nscene etc. \nIt is also a consistent way of sharing and reusing knowledge: if an ontology is shared by multiple \nusers working in a domain, they can use it to communicate and act on the included concepts without \nconcerns about confusion and ambiguity. \nMoreover, it allows for the semantic fusion of heterogeneous data collected in a single model. When \na situation calls for dealing with different type of data at the same time, such as satellite imagery, \nreports in various formats, posts from social media, videos etc., an ontology allows not only for the \ncorrelation  of  these  items  and  their  characteristics  together,  but  also  for  the  inference  of  new \nknowledge from such correlations between the data: if some operators are part of a movie crew and \nthat crew works on a movie, the ontology can be used by an inference engine to automatically infer \nthat those particular operators are involved in that movie, even though this information has not been \nexplicitly stated. \nThe following deliverable is divided in three parts. The first part provides an overview of the state \nof the art for knowledge and ontologies related to the SILVANUS field of operation. The second \npart explores the process of picking and choosing the most appropriate resources and methodologies \nfor the task goals. Finally, the ontology that resulted from task 3.1 activity is presented and described \nin the third part. \nThe ontology that is used by a system is the actual backbone of the information that  the system \ncollects, processes, and produces. However, based on the research performed in this work package \nit became apparent that important pieces of environmental and other types of information that should \nbe  collected  were  not  included  in  state-of-the-art  ontologies.

root - INFO - {'heading': '16 \n2\nIntroduction \nThe continuous rise of the Internet made many researchers wonder about the upcoming issues that \nwe will face. As everyone observes, the Internet is full of information that is constantly consumed \nby humans and machines.  \nWhile this information is available to everyone, extracting knowledge out this information is not a \ntrivial  task.  The  information  is  offered  in  structured  and  unstructured  forms  and  can  be  made \navailable through different formats and protocols. This creates a huge issue as to extract knowledge \nall this information needs to be homogenized, categorized, correlated.  \nTherefore, there is a need for a common language, a way to express similar things in the similar way \nso  that  entities  on  the  other  side,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  human,  or  machines  can  easily \nprocess them. This need set the basis of what we now call the semantic web, which the W3C defines \nwith the following quote: “The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to \nbe shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries”2.  \nTo reach this goal we need to define the “things” of each domain and how they interact with each \nother.  One  of  the  most  profound  ways  is  through  ontologies,  “an  explicit  specification  of  a \nconceptualization”3 as Gruber defines them.  \nOntologies  consist  of  a  set  of  terms,  the  vocabulary,  and  the  relationships  between  them.  It  is \nworthwhile to notice that the term vocabulary and ontology are often interchanged. In principle there \nis no difference between the two terms. In practice however, when we have many terms and a lot of \ncomplex relationships between the terms, we refer to it as ontology, if not, vocabulary. Thus, an \nontology can describe arbitrary things in a way that can be consumed by humans and machines, that \nis a format that is both machine and human readable. Currently, there are several languages that are \nspecifically designed to describe and annotate data like Resource Description Framework (RDF), \nWeb Ontology Language (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language (XML). The annotation part is \nimportant  as  it  allows  machines  to  process  information  and  extract  the  needed  information \nimmediately without the need to use other algorithms to perform e.g., natural language processing \nto infer what is exchanged. \nThis deliverable describes the SILVANUS first report on the modelling of a knowledge base. The \ngoal of this phase is to study the ontologies concerning the field of wildfires, crisis, environment, \nand biodiversity to use them to enrich unstructured data by automatically adding various types of \nannotations that can help in the prevention and fight of forest fires. These annotations will enable \nend-user functionalities such as decision support systems (DSS), through the process of automatic \nreasoning. \nThis report will be focused on the designing and evolving of one or more ontologies to be leveraged \nfor automatic and manual content categorization and entities extraction. \nThe whole Task 3.1 is about providing ontologies as a tool to standardize meaning and reason on it.  \n', 'content_font': 6, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

root - INFO - {'heading': '17 \nAn  ontology  is  an  explicit  formal  description  of  concepts  that  make  up  a  single  domain  of \nknowledge, meaning that if an ontology is shared by multiple users working in a domain, they can \nuse it to talk and act on the included concepts without concerns about confusion and ambiguity.  \nSo,  an  ontology  contains  a  description  of  concepts  that  make  up  a  domain  of  knowledge.  This \ndescription consists of a set of:  \n• Classes, the concepts themselves \n•\nIndividuals, which refer to the real-world instance of a concept or class (“The Matrix” is an \nindividual of the class Movie) \n• Relations between classes, stating how they are related together (Actor acts in Movie) \n• Attributes of classes, for example the name of a movie, the birth date of an actor \n• Restrictions  between  classes,  stating  for  example  that  if  a movie  is  labelled  for  adults,  it \ncannot also be labelled for kids \n• Axioms, stating for example that if a movie is produced by Pixar, it can be automatically \nlabelled for kids \nTo follow the requirements of the SILVANUS project with special regards to the knowledge model \nimplementation, a list of objectives has been identified:  \n•\nformalize the semantic description of different forest landscape models and threats posed by \nwildfires, based on biodiversity and fire danger index (T2.3) \n', 'content_font': 11, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

As we all know, the SILVANUS project is a \nmultidisciplinary project involving partners with different expertise. Each partner is specialized in \nthe use of certain data, related to specific concepts, identified by a specific terminology. So, to avoid \nthe project  becoming a tower of Babel,  a common terminology  must be used, and that common \nterminology is represented by the SILVANUS semantic framework, represented in Figure 1. \n', 'content_font': 9, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

root - INFO - {'heading': 'The SILVANUS semantic framework will serve as a robust terminological layer, accepting inputs \nfrom the sources on the left side of the picture and using them to populate the semantic model. The \nmodel will be capable of delivering a unified view of the available information to the end-user. \n18 \nTo  achieve  this,  however,  it  is  paramount  that  the  input  data  speaks  the  SILVANUS  ontology \nlanguage, in other words the input data must comply with the SILVANUS ontology schema that \nwill be defined in Task 3.1.  \nThis  is  the  only  way  we  can  ensure  interoperability  between  the  various  modules  that  will  be \ndeveloped  going  forward  and  avoid  semantic  disambiguation  problems  both  between  different \nconcepts in the same language and between different languages. \nWe divided the endeavour of building the semantic framework in two separate aspects: \n• The conceptual aspect (regarding ontologies, knowledge, etc.), which will be the topic of \nthis deliverable.  \n• The  technological  and  infrastructural  aspect  of  the  semantic  framework  (regarding  the \nunderlying infrastructure, databases, queries, etc.) which will be dealt with and described in \nTask 5.2. \nRegarding the conceptual aspect of the semantic framework, a series of subtasks was identified: \n• Knowledge collection, the effort to try and gather all the possible areas of knowledge that \nwill need to be formalized \n• Ontologies  and  dictionaries  collection,  consisting  in  the  search  for  pre-existing  resources \nthat can be leveraged to jumpstart the knowledge formalization \n• Domain definition, consisting in identifying the main classes, their relationship, attributes, \nrestrictions, axioms \n• Knowledge formalization itself, the building of the SILVANUS ontology. \nThe task of the conceptual aspect was decomposed in subtasks and each partner was proposed to \ngive their contributions to one or more of such sub sections. In the following chapter, the collection \nof the state of the art will be described. \n19 \n3 State of the Art \nIn this phase the goal is to collect all the latest resources and methodologies that could be useful for \nthe goal of creating the SILVANUS ontology. The section is divided in two subsections: knowledge \ncollection and ontologies/taxonomies collection. \nIn  the  knowledge  collection  section,  the  goal  has  been  to  gather  all  the  possible  sources  of \nknowledge  that  is  relevant  to  the  three  phases  of  the  SILVANUS  project  (prevention  of  fire, \ndetection  of  fire,  restoration  of  the  environment),  coming  from  partners,  experts  and  other \ndeliverables. \nIn the ontologies and taxonomies section the goal has been to identify already available and well-\nestablished  schematizations  of  knowledge  to  reuse  their  relevant  concepts  and  relations  while \nallowing the SILVANUS platform to be interoperable with other systems that use such schemas. \n3.1 Knowledge Collection \nThe SILVANUS Knowledge Base can be considered the real backbone of the entire SILVANUS \nproject. It will need to effectively manage all kinds of information from all kinds of sources as well \nas all the possible interactions between these pieces of information.  \nIn the knowledge collection phase, there has been research for new requirements and information \nthat need to be kept into consideration for the job of the user products that will run on top of the \nSILVANUS Knowledge Base. The main sources of such information were the following:  \n• Other deliverables \n• Knowledge from partners  \n• Knowledge from real systems, through the pilots \nIn particular, Deliverable 2.1 was released in May 2022 and it reports an in-depth description of all \nthe  operational  scenarios  from  the  pilots  in  the  project,  which  represent  a  great  source  of \ninformation.  \nMoreover, some of the partners left their comments on the ontology draft design which has been \npresented during the Zvolen assembly in March 2022 and Bari assembly in July 2022, adding their \nfeedback and suggestions. \n3.1.1 Knowledge from pilots \nThe colleagues working on Task 2.1 carried out the collection of Pilot requirements by getting in \ntouch with the experts of the domain. From this activity it was possible to extract a series of relevant \nconcepts, some of them were already included in the SILVANUS ontology, some others that were \nincluded in light of this activity. \nThe following tables from 1 to 6 show all the raw concepts that have been extracted from each pilot \ndescription: \n', 'content_font': 9, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

A class 1 fire (400 Kw/m) can be expected with flames no more \n30 \nthan 1 meter high and therefore can be tackled by ground crews with the use of hand and mechanical \ntools (flails, rakes, sprayers) without difficulties. \nThere is then a certain number of areas where class 2 fire behaviour can be expected. In this case, \nfires with flames of 1-2 meters can be expected that can no longer be tackled solely with hand tools \nbut instead require firefighting vehicles equipped with firefighting modules. \nThe areas where higher linear intensity is expected (Class 3 and 4) can be expected especially at \nopen shrub and arboreal areas, which could carry fires that are very difficult to control and suppress. \nThese areas have shrub layers, evolved and stable evergreen ilex degradation formations (thickets \nand garrigue) in which violent fire front behaviour, high propagation velocities and very high flames \n(even above 10 meters) can be expected. In such types of fires, spotting phenomena, jumping of \nburning sparks with related danger of multiple ignitions, fire front splitting and loss of control of \nfirefighting operations are common. In these situations, ground crews must be careful and follow \nprotocols to operate safely, and water-heavy ground means, aerial means and indirect front attack \nmust be used. \n3.1.4 Causes \nAccording to the Sardinian pilot, to date there are no generalized or otherwise unambiguous models \nthat can be adapted to all levels of fire risk scale, especially in the case of relatively small spatial \nareas such as the one of the pilot in case. \nThe risk analysis was, therefore, conducted based on conducive factors, under the assumption that \nthe probability of fire initiation and development is mainly determined by climatic conditions and \nfuel characteristics, particularly its moisture content. \nGiven the existence of little information on the causes of past events in the area under study, the \nfocus  was  therefore  mainly  on  the  classification  of  vegetation  into  fire  behaviour  patterns,  land \ncharacteristics,  and  meteorological  factors  affecting  the  probability  of  pyrological  event  spread. \nBoth the quantity and the size of the vegetation fuel depend on the characteristics of the vegetation, \nand in this sense the different forest types detected during the surveys are a very important element \nin determining the fire behaviour and the intensity of the flame front. \n3.1.4.1 Conducive factors \nConducive factors are those variables that directly affect the conditions conducive to fire spread, \nnamely type of burnable fuel  (fuel  patterns), topographical  conditions  (altitude, slope, exposure) \nand meteorological conditions (air temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction). \nTable  8,  shared  by  our  PNRT  partners,  shows  the  spatial  distribution  of  fuel  models  within  the \nTepilora Oasis forest complex. As can be seen, the most represented pattern is for subparts in which \nfire propagates predominantly by green fuel of the shrub component in formations characterized by \nan almost uniform horizontal continuity (40.4 percent).

root - INFO - {'heading': '33 \nInformation,  dissemination,  and  awareness-raising  activities  can  be  carried  out  using  Forests  as \nCentres of Experience, and possibly as laboratories. \nIn this regard, the Oasis of Tepilora is part of a network of Service Centres, included in the INFEA \ncircuit,  which  has  as  a  priority  objective  to  organically  structure  the  activity  of  Environmental \nInformation,  Dissemination  and  Awareness  on  Forests,  ensuring  qualified  personnel,  stable \nstructures and teaching methodologies based on the possibility of acquiring "experience" directly in \nthe field. \nSince the causes of fire are mostly anthropogenic, accidental, or culpable, information is an effective \nmeans of fire prevention, especially when it is aimed directly at forest users during the peak warning \nperiod. \nActive forestry. It includes all those interventions aimed at reducing the ignition potential and the \namount of fuel, as well as more generally improving the overall forest vegetation structure according \nto the characteristics of the Mediterranean environment. \nIt  is  mainly  in  direct  prevention  through  silvicultural  operations  that  the  action  of  the  detailed \nforestry plan can take place. Already with the implementation of the silvicultural and infrastructural \ninterventions envisaged in the plan (thinnings, road maintenance, etc.), the fuel load of some high-\nrisk formations should be reduced, and the active control phases made more effective. In addition \nto these, however, it should be acted upon specific preventive measures aimed at: \n•\nimplementing planned, and constant over time, measures to reduce the possibility of \nvegetation formations to be traversed by fire; \n• achieving more easily manageable extinction conditions. \nIn the context of the Tepilora Oasis possible interventions can be identified in four main activities: \nprescribed fire, clearing, thinning, and clearing. \nPrescribed Fire. Prescribed fire is an expert application of fire on planned surfaces, in which precise \nprescriptions and operating procedures are adopted to achieve desired effects and achieve objectives \nintegrated into land use planning. \nThe objective of an intervention with this technique, is to achieve, or avoid, specific effects on the \nenvironment  and  particularly  on  vegetation.  The  desired  effect,  except  in  special  cases,  is  to \ntransform  the  structure  of  vegetation  (load,  cover,  horizontal  and  vertical  continuity),  while \nundesirable effects such as changing soil, air, and water properties or harming wildlife are to be \navoided. Some examples of the prescribed fire management scope, in addition to the scope of fire \nprevention, relate to habitat conservation, wildlife management, and the education and training of \nforest firefighting personnel in fire handling. \nIn the area of fire prevention, the prescribed fire technique is generally used for the reduction of fuel \nload and continuity, and its application, through careful design, can be carried out, for example, for \nthe restoration/maintenance of firebreaks, for the creation of safety strips close to valuable forests, \nand for the removal of shrub fuel in open areas or under cover, especially in the presence of conifers. \nAll operations carried out using the prescribed fire technique should be carried out in the winter-\nspring period, and in any case always within the implementation window provided in the design. \nClearing, thinning, shoveling. Clearing (removal of herbaceous and shrubby undergrowth, with \nrespect  to  established  broadleaf  regeneration,  and  dead  fuel),  to  be  beneficial,  must  extend  over \nsignificant areas and affect roads, trails, and interface areas. \n34 \nThe urban-rural  interface is  defined as those  zones,  areas, or belts,  in  which the interconnection \nbetween anthropogenic structures and natural areas is very close: that is, these are those geographic \nplaces where the urban and rural systems meet and interact, so that they are at risk of interface fire, \nbeing able to come into rapid contact with the possible spread of a fire originating in combustible \nvegetation. Such a fire, in fact, can originate either in the vicinity of the settlement (e.g., due to the \nlighting  of  fires  during  recreational  activities  in  equipped  areas,  sparks  caused  by  power  plants, \netc...), or as a proper forest fire to then affect the interface areas. \nThinnings  are  critically  important  in  reducing  the  likelihood  of  fire  development,  especially  in \nconiferous  forests,  where  they  are  sometimes  oriented  toward  encouraging  the  establishment  of \nbroadleaf  trees  consistent  with  local  vegetation  series.  On  the  other  hand,  they  can  also  be \ncounterproductive when they favour the development and establishment of scrub species. In such \ncases, it will be convenient to maintain high tree floor cover at least in areas adjacent to roads where \nthe likelihood of initiation is highest. \nCombined with thinning and clearing operations, in coniferous reforestations, scrubbing up to 1/3 \nof the stem height can provide a degree of prevention, in some cases averting the passage of fire \ninto the canopy. \n3.1.6 Biodiversity and Environment \nThe term biodiversity encapsulates all the diversity of life on Earth - habitats, populations, and genes \n- and its disruption can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and human life. Open space \nfires and wildfires are a key destabilizing factor for forest ecosystems.  \nBiodiversity  is  affected  by almost  all human activities (e.g., industrialization, transport, tourism, \nintensive  agriculture,  forestry,  etc.),  and  it  is  necessary  to  predict  and  prevent  the  causes  of  the \ndisappearance  of  biological  diversity  on  Earth.  The  protection  of  biodiversity  includes  the \nassessment of the state of endangered species, and the protection of species (plant and animal), i.e., \nin natural habitats and outside natural habitats - in zoos, arboretums, botanical gardens, seed banks, \netc. \nForest fires occur as a natural phenomenon or because of human activity, which often causes fires \nin  continental  forests.  Every  fire  has  an  immense  impact  on  habitats  and  biodiversity, \ndestruction/reduction  of  general  useful  functions  of  forests  and  species  migration.  Although  the \nnegative consequences are visible, the positive ones can be observed only after two or three growing \nyears, when pioneer and climate-forming species in that habitat create the conditions for a new start \nand development of the ecosystem in a common correlation. In the long term, it is the landowner \nthat  is  the  main  responsible  actor  in  the  creation  of  a  fire  resilient  environment.  They  can  help \nprevent the devastating effects of uncontrolled fires by managing the land as well as using fire itself \nin a controlled way. This is true especially in mountain continental forests, which are among the \nmost vulnerable environments. \nThe increase in the number of fires affects the natural regeneration of the ecosystem, and as a result, \nin some areas, this leads to a decrease in biodiversity and an increase in soil erosion. All of this can \nultimately lead to the devastation of the land space, which leads to an increase in the cost of restoring \nthese  land  spaces  and  returning  them  to  their  original  state.  The  activities  that  should  be \nimplemented to strengthen biodiversity from the perspective of fire protection are: \n35 \n• Application of new technologies and procedures that will contribute to the efficiency of the \n•\nfirefighting and civil protection systems in forest fire management. \nInteroperability of existing procedures and plans that will reduce bureaucracy and increase \nthe  efficiency  of  the  firefighting  system  and  civil  protection  in  the  field  of  forest  fire \nmanagement. \n• Afforestation activities in groups, covering smaller areas where there are seedlings planted \nin greater density. The advantages of these fences are reflected in the preservation of the \nanimals of the area, but also of biodiversity in general. \nThese activities can contribute to a better organized and more efficient suppression of forest fires, \nreducing the ecological impact and threats to biological diversity. \nKey aspects of biodiversity and environment in a context of wildfire management should include \nand  integrate  the  structural,  compositional,  and  functional  dimensions  that  define  the  ecological \nsystem5 depicted in Figure 5, including their abiotic environment, and the different stages of wildfire \nmanagement.

It is \nsometimes referenced to Portuguese geography and legal system, but the shared knowledge can be \ngeneralized for usage in the context of the SILVANUS project. \nMajor accidents and disasters have their origins in a wide variety of natural phenomena as well as \nin technical-technological processes and represent a significant social and economic burden for all \ncountries.  Vegetation  fires  occur  as  a  cause-and-effect  relationship  between  climatic  factors,  the \nstate of fuel material (humidity, types of plant cover and the amount of wood and other biomass) \nand  human  activity.  This  results  in  hard-to-compensate  economic  damages,  large  reconstruction \ncosts and other indirect and direct losses. Such fires are the cause of disruption of biological and \nlandscape  diversity  and  contaminate  the  air  in  a  narrow  area,  but  also  cause  long-term  damage \nthrough the emission of carbon dioxide. \nForest fires, in addition to all the above, can have an impact on the perception of the global security \nof the country (especially countries that are popular tourist destinations). Thus, the elements of the \nentire protection system (preventive and operational) gain importance in the future and must have a \ndevelopment  priority.  Surely  the  basis  for  thinking  about  reducing  the  risk  of  forest  fires  is  the \ncreation of risk assessments in accordance with international guidelines to ensure quality and mutual \ncompliance/comparability. \nRisk assessment is primarily the determination of quantitative and/or qualitative risk values, and the \nrisk of forest fires is evaluated more closely. All participants at the national, regional and local level \nshould participate in this process, and the document should specify the basic characteristics of the \narea,  identification  of  threats  and  risks,  criteria  of  social  values  for  determining  the  impact  on \npeople's lives and health, economy and social stability and politics, probability/frequency tables, \nscenarios  for  wildfires  (with  the  worst  possible  consequences),  matrices  for  the  results  of  risk \nassessment, risk evaluation and mapping of forest fire risk. \nOne of the civil protection measures implemented in case of large fires with the aim of protecting \nthe population and animals is evacuation. Evacuation means the relocation of endangered persons, \nanimals and movable property from endangered objects or areas. It is one of the civil protection \nmeasures  implemented  by  all  participants  in  the  civil  protection  system.  Evacuation  is  a  very \ndemanding activity to implement and must be planned and carried out as soon as possible to protect \npeople's  health  and  lives.  It  is  extremely  important  to  use  the  early  warning  system  in  a  timely \nmanner to inform the public about the potential threat of large open space fires so that the population \ncan prepare for a possible evacuation and evacuate independently in accordance with the situation \nand in accordance with the instructions of the civil protection. \nRecommendations on how to develop capacities for timely evacuation in case of large forest fires: \n40 \n• Development of early warning and alarm systems with the aim of informing the resident \npopulation and tourists in a timely manner about taking the necessary protection and self-\nprotection measures in the event of an open space fire. \n• Raising of public awareness  through informal education about  the implementation of the \nevacuation by the participants and operational forces of the civil protection system. \n• Special  care  for  people  with  special  needs  and  patients  from  medical  institutions  when \ncarrying out the evacuation \n• Regular training of the operational forces of the civil protection system in cooperation with \nlegal entities from the tourism sector before the start of the fire season \n• Regular inspections before the fire season against legal entities in the tourism sector (e.g., \nhotels, camps).  \nThe  following  sections  will  present  some  of  the  critical  infrastructures  and  structures  to  be \nsafeguarded during a fire event. \n3.1.7.1 Electrical Utilities Infrastructure \nElectrical  infrastructure  is  a  type  of  critical  infrastructure  that  can  be  subjected  to  damages  and \nfailure caused by wildfires. Fire damages to electrical infrastructure are particularly critical because \nthese  can  then  have  a  domino  effect  on  the  wildfire,  causing  disruption  on  the  distribution  of \nelectricity, which is used to power several services and equipment, such as communications and \nwater  pumping  stations,  which  in  turn  are  essential  for  coordinated  and  effective  fire  response \nactions  by  the  emergency  services  and  the  population.  Thus,  increasing  even  further  the  risk  of \nimpact  on  human  lives,  ecosystems,  and  material  goods.  Therefore,  the  protection  of  electrical \nInfrastructure is imperative. In SILVANUS the partner with the expertise on electrical systems is \nEDP, the Portuguese electrical utility. So, the analysis on this kind of infrastructures was done for \nthe Portuguese geographical and legal context. \n3.1.7.1.1 Distribution Grid Overhead Electrical Lines  \nOverhead electrical lines are an essential part of the electrical grid that are at particular risk of being \naffected by wildfires since they spam over thousands of kilometres commonly through rural areas \nwith large amounts of vegetation, that are prone to large wildfires.  \nAccording to the Portuguese Decree-Law no. 82/2021, of 13 October, protection areas, defined as \nfuel management strips, must exist around the overhead lines, with a minimum width of 10 meters \non each side, for high voltage (HV) lines, and 7 meters on each  side, for medium voltage (MV) \nlines.  E-Redes,  EDP  Group  distribution  company  manages  approximately  68  thousand  km  in \ncontinental Portugal, of which around 59 thousand km are MV lines, and 9 thousand km are HV \nlines.  \nThe maintenance work to clear vegetation from the fuel management strips is therefore an enormous \ntask,  where  efficient  techniques  need  to  be  applied  both  to  keep  the  schedule  of  the  works  and \nmaintenance costs as low as possible. \nThe use of UAV and helicopters equipped with LIDAR, Multispectral, RGB and Thermographic \nsensors  is  currently  the  most  used  method  to  cover  and  monitor  the  vegetation  in  these  areas. \nAdditionally, earth observation satellites are also a source that can be used.  \n", 'content_font': 11, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}
--Depending on what remote sensing technology is used, the resulting output for the fuel management 
strips can be the following: 3D point clouds classified on type of vegetation (grass, shrub, trees and 
other), vegetation species/family, infrastructure (overhead line, line tower and line pole) and other 
obstacles; or maps of ground cover type and estimated volume of biomass. 






root - INFO - {'heading': '41 \nCriticality for different sections of the distribution grid also needs to be determined, to coordinate \nthe clearing activities. This criticality can be based on many factors such as the number of clients \nthat a section serves, surrounding vegetation species and technical details (voltage, materials, and \nothers). \n3.1.7.1.1.1 Barrier Effect associated with the Fuel Management Strips around Overhead Electrical \nLines  \nAssociated with the fuel management strips is a barrier effect on wildfires. This barrier effect is \nstrongly influenced by land uses, for example, water lines, roads, and the fuel management strips, \nwhich present lower barrier effect than the previous ones6. In the context of agricultural uses, the \neffect of the fuel management strips around the electrical lines as a fire barrier is null. Pine and \neucalyptus have a barrier effect, even so, with lower values than water lines and roads (for the same \nsituation).  \nRegarding  mosaics,  the  land  uses  with  the  highest  barrier  effect  were  agriculture,  agro-forestry \nsystems, wetlands, and urban. In the context of these land uses, the effect of linear structures is much \nsmaller. Mosaics of these systems alone are one of the most efficient ways to reduce the spread of \nfires at the landscape level. The barrier indices of linear structures vary greatly depending on the \nland  use  context  in  which  they  are  located,  confirming  the  importance  of  mosaics  as  the  most \nsignificant  structures  in  the  context  of  fire  spread.  Managing  the  landscape  in  a  holistic  and \nintegrated approach is therefore a more robust solution. \n3.1.7.1.2 Hydroelectric Power Plants \nRegarding  generation,  hydroelectric  power  plants  are  especially  vulnerable  to  wildfires.  This \nexposure is caused mainly by the impact of fire debris on the waterbodies. Fire debris can impact \non the generation assets by putting the turbines out of service, but also can cause indirect exploitation \nproblems by deteriorating the ecological status of the water bodies. To mitigate these situations, \nhydroelectric power plants must set a protection area and must perform maintenance works in the \ndams and reservoirs surrounding perimeter. \n3.1.7.2 Water Utilities Infrastructure \nThe integrated management of the urban water cycle includes all the stages, ranging from water \nabstraction,  treatment,  and  distribution  for  public  consumption  to  the  collection,  transport, \ntreatment, and disposal of urban wastewater.  \nIn the Portuguese demonstration subregion, several dozens of facilities are in remote, isolated areas, \nsurrounded by vegetation which maintenance is hard to keep, making them vulnerable to wildfires. \nAny wildfire can easily put in danger these facilities, destroy the natural heritage, jeopardize the \naccess to water and / or sanitation services for the population as well as for firefighting purposes. \n So, keeping the critical facilities surroundings clean of vegetation is a continuing challenge that \nneeds constant fuel management work to minimize the risk. \n', 'content_font': 6, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

Therefore, the protection \nof electrical infrastructure is imperative. \n3.1.7.2.1 Water Intakes, Treatment Plants, Pumping Stations, and Water Reservoirs \nIn SILVANUS the partner with the expertise on water systems is AdP, the Portuguese water utility. \nSo, the analysis on this kind of infrastructures was done for the Portuguese geographical and legal \ncontext. \nThese are an essential part of the water supply system that are at particular risk of being affected by \nwildfires since they are located commonly through rural areas with large amounts of vegetation, that \nare prone to large wildfires.  \nConsidering that all those infrastructures are equipped with electromechanical devices, a fire event \ncan easily impact on their operability and affect the water supply to the populations as well as for \nfirefighting purposes. \nThe obligation to maintain the fuel management strip networks is one of the preventive measures \nprovided for in the Portuguese Decree-Law no. 124/2006, de 28 de Junho, with the objective of \nreducing  the  number  of  rural  fires,  with  land  clearing  being  the  most  common  practice  of  fuel \nmanagement, through the cutting and removal of existing plant biomass in these strips. \nIn this area, the XXI Constitutional Portuguese Government created the Agency for the Integrated \nManagement of Rural Fires, I. P. (AGIPFR), under the terms of Decree-Law no. (MAAC) would \nhave to report on a weekly basis the evolution of the biomass surrounding the infrastructures. \nIn addition to the Portuguese legislation, the defense of the forest against fires and the integrated \nmanagement of rural fires is also regulated by an annual Order that identifies priority parishes for \ncarrying out planning and deforestation work (Portuguese Order No. 3403/2021 of 30 December \nMarch), and by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers nº 45-A/2020 that approves the National \n(Portuguese) Plan for the Integrated Management of Rural Fires. On the other hand, the importance \nof  the  executive  nature  and  operational  programming  of  municipal  and  local  planning  is  also \nhighlighted,  which  must  comply  with  regional  and  local  guidelines  and  priorities,  in  a  logic  of \nnational contribution. \nIn the context of Grupo Águas de Portugal (AdP) companies, fire prevention and fuel management \ninvolve  weekly  report  of  biomass  surrounding  its  infrastructures  as  well  as  carrying  out \ndeforestation works and reporting them to the MAAC under the terms of the law. In compliance \nwith the provisions of Portuguese Decree-Law no. 12/2018 of 16 February, in February 2019 the \nOffice of the Secretary of State for the Environment requested that AdP, and consequently all the \nGroup's  operating  companies,  provide  from  that  date  a  report  of  the  areas  to  be  deforested  with \nperiodicities  defined  by  the  competent  authorities,  different  between  weekly  and  fortnightly, \naccording to the time of year and the inherent risks of ignition.  \n43 \nThe visual inspection is currently the most used method to cover and monitor the vegetation in these \nareas,  which  makes  the  process  very  “heavy”  and  inefficient  considering  the  large  number  of \ninfrastructures and their dispersion through the territory. \nThe maintenance work to clear vegetation from the fuel management is therefore an enormous task \nwhere  efficient  techniques  need  to  be  applied  both  to  keep  the  schedule  of  the  works  and \nmaintenance costs as low as possible. \nInfrastructures’  criticality  also  needs  to  be  determined  to  prioritize  the  clearing  activities. \nAdditionally, to optimize the logistics associated to those activities, the infrastructures are clustered \nby working areas and the clearing activities will be planned to cover all the infrastructures within \nthe targeted area.   \nCritical  infrastructures  are  the  ones  located  within  or  that  supplies  water  to  priority  areas  for \nprevention  and  safety  (PAPS),  which  correspond  to  the  ‘high’  and  ‘extremely  high’  fire  danger \nclasses and may include other areas, albeit less hazardous, where there is a recognised interest in \nprotecting them and provided, they are included in the planning instrument.  \n3.1.7.2.2 Water Piping \nEmergency firefighting teams rely in part on operable water pumps and distribution network and \nmust take more ad hoc measures to secure water supply if system fail.  \nLoss  of  water  service  to  local  hospitals  and  other  vital  facilities  can  compound  the  impacts  of \nwildfire on a community. Additionally, loss of pressure in water service lines can allow soil and \ncontaminants  to  enter  the  piping  system.  Keeping  water  systems  operable  during  a  wildfire \nemergency can be difficult, as fire may damage water system infrastructure, spreading fire can leave \nkey parts of water system infrastructure inaccessible and backup power generators may fail. \nThe  water  pipes  are  mostly  underground,  so  those  are  not  the  most  affected  assets  in  a  wildfire \nscenario, however laboratory tests showed that high temperatures impair the plastic pipes that are \nused  for  water  distribution  and  home  plumbing.  The  heat  caused  the  pipes  in  the  experiment  to \ndegrade and leach benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and other compounds into water. \nTaking  it  into  account,  special  attention  to  fuel  management  shall  be  paid  to  critical  locations, \nspecially where the plastic pipelines vertical alignment is higher and closer to the surface. \n3.1.7.2.3 Wastewater Treatment Plants \nLike water systems, wastewater systems are also vulnerable to wildfire events. The malfunctioning \nof pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants might cause discharge of untreated effluents \nwith potential negative impacts in the environment. \nThe obligation to maintain the fuel management strip networks is one of the preventive measures \nprovided for in Portuguese Decree-Law no. 124/2006, de 28 de Junho, with the objective of reducing \nthe number of rural fires, with land clearing the most common practice of fuel management, through \nthe cutting and removal of existing plant biomass in these strips. \n", 'content_font': 11, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

The  visual  inspection  is  currently  the  most  used  method  to  cover  and  monitor  the \nvegetation in these areas. \n2. The  maintenance  work  to  clear  vegetation  from  the  fuel  management  is  therefore  an \nenormous task. \n3. Critical infrastructures are the ones located within priority areas for prevention and safety \n(PAPS).  \n3.1.7.3\nInfrastructure of silvopastoral interest. \nThe main infrastructures of silvopastoral interest reported by the Sardinian pilot are briefly \ndescribed below. \nSloughs and bridges. The most important structure of this type is the bridge over the Riu s'Aragone, \nin the forest of Sos Littos Sas Tumbas, on the main access road to Sos Littos, which provides access \nto the Gianni Stuppa Barracks. Just downstream of the bridge is flanked by a ford, in suboptimal \ncondition and for which restoration work is needed, which serves the transit of large vehicles that \ncannot use the bridge. Another important ford is the one located at Piras, on the Posada River, just \noutside the Sos Littos forest, which is also used to access the forest (mainly in good season, when \nthe water level of the river allows it). Otherwise, only a few concrete or masonry bridges, wooden \nfootbridges  (in  the  Crastazza  forest)  are  found  along  the  internal  road  system,  generally  in  fair \ncondition  while  the  fords  (also  all  but  one  located  at  Sos  Littos,  in  the  Crastazza  forest)  need \nmaintenance in many cases. \nBars and gates. All the main access roads to the three forests are equipped with functional gates to \npossibly restrict access (although in many cases they are generally kept open). \n3.1.7.4 Firefighting infrastructure. \nFire  avenues.  In  all  three  forests  there  are  fire  avenues  arranged  along  much  of  the  boundaries \n(including those between Sos Littos and Crastazza) and in some cases there are also fire avenues \nwithin the forests themselves.  \nSmall lakes and ponds. Fire-fighting ponds are present in all three forests; in Usinavà there are \nthree  artificial ponds  (in PF D2  and D11) of  which the largest  one measures about  3700 m2,  in \nCrastazza there is a pond just over 2000 m2 (in PF C81) while in Sos Littos Sas Tumbas there is the \nlargest pond, in Prammas, of about 7700 m2 (PF A37) in addition to a smaller pond on the slopes \nof Punta Tepilora. The three larger ponds at Usinavà, Crastazza and Sos Littos, are also surveyed as \nsub-ponds. In addition to the ponds, there are also two concrete fire tubs at Sos Littos, both along \nthe road in the Badde e' Deremita area. \nFire lookout posts. Overall, there are three fire lookout posts; they are in all three cases buildings \nand  therefore  filed  as  buildings  and  not  as  infrastructure,  but  are  treated  in  this  section  for \nhomogeneity of function. They are masonry buildings, in good condition and regularly used. \n3.1.7.5 Other infrastructures \nIn this category are included all infrastructures that do not primarily relate to silvo-pastoral and fire \nmanagement. Brief mentions of those of major importance are given below. \nAqueducts  and/or  related  works  and  water  storage.  There  are  several  small  constructions, \nusually made of reinforced concrete, attributable to aqueducts, water catchments and storage, final \n45 \ndiversion and water management serving aqueduct lines or main buildings or even, in some cases \nserving firefighting facilities. \nEquipped rest areas. Equipped rest areas are many, with facilities often limited to wooden and/or \nstone tables; sometimes there are also fountains and barbecue facilities. These areas are generally \nlocated along the roadway and in good condition. Although tourist use of the forest is rather limited, \nthe area deserves to be restored. \nFountains. Fountains are distributed in Sos Littos and Crastazza, along the main roads, either as \nindividual infrastructures or in the context of equipped areas. The masonry fountains present near \nthe Crastazza barracks are particularly used by the population. \nQuarries. Several small quarries are present along the main road system (with areas in the order of \nhundreds or often as little as a few tens of m2) from which material was used in the past for the \nrestoration of that same road system. \nWalls and fences. In the forest of Sos Littos and that of Usinavà, there are wildlife fences in varying \nstates of decay \n3.1.7.6 Buildings \nEach building in the Sardinian pilot was located by GPS or by carryover on a field map (in cases \nwhere the location on CTR and orthoimagery was clear and evident) and indexed, as shown in Table \n13, by detecting certain parameters that then went on to form the building database.

In addition to these three main centers, a small \nequipped service shelter is also worth mentioning in Punta Pedra Niedda, in the forest of Sos Littos \nSas Tumbas, which falls in the municipality of Alà dei Sardi (SF B2/3). \nBuildings with tourist-recreational functions. At the Usinavà Barracks, along with the service \nbuildings,  there  are  also  tourist-recreational  facilities,  both  receptive  (guest  quarters)  and  other \n(toilets, areas with tables and fires), already used in past years through concessions to cooperatives. \nIn the Sos Littos site center, the building of the old Gianni Stuppa barracks has been renovated (work \nwas  nearing  completion  at  the  time  of  the  survey),  which  could  also  have  a  tourist-recreational \ndestination,  with  facilities  suitable  for  reception  and  catering.  Similarly,  a  building  has  been \ncompletely renovated (again, work was nearing completion at the time of the survey) in Crastazza \nForest, Suburgo (SF C82/2), with possible tourist-recreational or even educational use. \nBuildings  with  firesighting  functions.  There  are  three  buildings  with  functions  of  fire  lookout \nposts, therefore treated together with the firesighting infrastructure. \n3.1.8\nIntegrated effects \nThe impact of wildfire events cannot be analysed separately for electrical and water infrastructures \nand biodiversity. There can be domino, co-joint and cross effects that can change completely the \nwildfire progression and impact. Most of these effects occur in the wildfire fighting phase, that is, \nduring the prevention phase its impact its negligible.  \nDomino effects occur when a cumulative effect is produced where one event (or a combination of \nevents) initiates the succession of other events7, usually not expected when analysing solely by the \nfirst. A co-joint effect is when the occurrence of two events has a higher outcome than the algebraic \nsum of each one occurring separately. Finally, a cross effect occurs when there is an unexpected \ncausal relation between two events. \nAffected electrical infrastructures can cause disruption in water supply and communications, thus \nhindering  wildfire  prevention  and  fighting.  Water  utilities  infrastructures  can  also  impact  the \nwildfire prevention and fight. On the other hand, biodiversity and environment can impact on fire \n", 'content_font': 6, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

root - INFO - {'heading': '48 \n3.1.9 Climate \nRegarding climate, the Italian pilot from Sardinia shared some information about combinations of \ntemperature and udometric data.  \nBy combining thermal data with udometric data and calculating factors such as potential and actual \nevapotranspiration,  numerous  types  of  diagrams  can  be  constructed  to  summarize  the  thermo-\npluviometric components of the considered stations and at the same time provide some information \non the water regime of the soils. The diagrams used to define the climatic conditions of the area are \nas follows: \n• monthly and annual average values of precipitation and temperatures. \n• Bagnouls and Gaussen diagrams, in which rainfall is compared with temperatures at a scale \ntwice that of rainfall. \n• water balance diagrams according to Thornthwaite, which classifies the climate of a region \naccording to the "balance" of a system that receives water mainly from meteoric inflows and \ngives it back in the form of evapotranspiration. \nOther parameters also prove important in estimating the water balance: \n•\n•\nthe  water  deficit  (D)  i.e.,  the  difference  between  potential  evapotranspiration  and  actual \nevapotranspiration,  which  allows  estimating  the  amount  of  water  needed  to  balance  the \nlosses due to potential evapotranspiration. \nthe water surplus (S), which indicates the amount of water that, once the soil water supply \nis saturated, goes into groundwater and surface runoff. \nHaving determined these values, indices expressing the degree of aridity and humidity of an area \ncan be obtained: it is precisely based on these indices that the "climate formula" is determined. In \naddition, according to Thornthwaite, the magnitude of the water balance, but especially the values \nit takes during the year, are important to understand what conditions of water availability (or deficit) \nare affecting the plants. \nAnother important factor for the purpose of calculating the water balance is the amount of water \nthat the soil can store within it (useful water or A.W.C.) and that may be usable for plants. This \ndepends on various factors, including the depth of the soil itself, the amount of skeleton and the \norganic matter content. Of course, it must be  considered that climatic parameters vary as certain \nfactors change, such as exposure, altitude, layering, and orographic pattern. \n3.2 Ontologies and Taxonomies \nFor the instantiation of the proposed semantic component, which was explained in section 3.1, we \nmust create an ontology which attempts to cover the most relevant concepts around the emergency \nsimulation process.

At the European level a \nsimple  common  scheme  with  4  fire  cause  classes  (deliberate,  accident/negligence,  natural  and \nunknown) has been used to record information on fire causes since 1992. \nUp  until  2013,  European  countries  used  national  schemes  which  in  most  cases  are  much  more \ndetailed  than  these  simple  4  common  classes,  but  they  are  not  harmonized,  and  detailed  cross-\ncountry comparisons are difficult. This led to the need for a new EU scheme that is harmonized \nacross  European  countries  and  that  is  able  to  improve  the  information  level  and  the  common \nknowledge on the origin of forest fires in Europe. The scheme is hierarchical and is made of 29 fire \ncause classes, 8 groups and 6 categories. \nThis  harmonized  fire  cause  classification  scheme  is  expected  to  be  adopted  by  the  countries \nparticipating to the EFFIS network in the coming years, and therefore be recorded in the European \nFire Database, with a significant added value for the knowledge about the origin of forest fires in \nEurope. A key feature of the new scheme is that common fire causes categories  must be widely \nagreed/recognized;  in  addition,  clear  and  unambiguous  definitions  are  integral  part  of  the  new \nclassification scheme. \nThe new fire causes classification scheme has 3 hierarchical levels.

Additionally,  since  several  ontologies  and  datasets  exist  for  the \n68 \ndomains we use, by creating our own terms and linking them to several external ontologies, \nwe do not limit the user to one of them: they can choose the set of alignment modules of \ntheir preference. \n2. Make  safe  reuse  of  external  ontologies  and  data.  While  reuse  of  data  is  a  well-known \nprinciple in the Semantic Web, making explicit alignment (that is, linking the terms of the \nontology with terms of the external ontology by means of the properties mentioned before) \nis considered a better practice that direct reuse of the terms. Direct reuse has the risk of what \nis known as ontology hijacking, that is, giving additional semantics to external terms that \ncan negatively impact the semantics of the data (e.g., generating undesirable inferences). \n3.2.8 BIMERR Weather Ontology21\nThe BIMERR project is related to the Building Information Modelling (BIM) and its main target \nare  stakeholders  from  the  Architecture,  Engineering  &  Construction  field.

Such models are defined following a modular approach, that is in the shape of a network, in \nwhich each domain (KPI, materials, building, etc.) could be reuse independently. \nAmong the various modules of the BIMERR ontology network there is one for weather phenomena \nand exterior conditions that could be useful in the context of the SILVANUS ontology.

This deliberate approach was guided by two fundamental \nconsiderations. Firstly, it is important to highlight that the harmonization of fire causes reported \namong all the countries in the European Union had already been expertly executed within the \nseminal work of the Joint Research Centre's EFFIS report10. Secondly, it is noteworthy that our \n90 \nproject proposal explicitly outlined our commitment to retaining EFFIS as a steadfast reference \npoint with respect to categories pertaining to fire causes. Consequently, it is imperative to \nemphasize that the causes we reference are exclusively those declared within the EFFIS report. \nThis commitment to the original taxonomy ensures not only terminological consistency but also a \ncomprehensive alignment with the established standards. As such, figure 35, detailing these \ncauses, shall serve as a point of reference, both from a terminology perspective and in terms of the \nlevel of detail. \n", 'content_font': 9, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

This work came together to give light to the first version \nof  the  SILVANUS  ontology,  which  aims  at  structuring  into  a  single  ontology  the  elements  of \nstrength of all the others that were taken into consideration. \nSeveral ontologies have been considered for the task of covering all the knowledge relevant to the \nSILVANUS project. Many of those only had a limited set of concepts that were relevant. To avoid \nlittering the SILVANUS ontology with many irrelevant classes, relations, and data types, and to \nkeep the full control of its content, it was decided in agreement with Catalink to replicate in the \nSILVANUS ontology just the relevant entities from other ontologies and to loosely link them to the \noriginal ones using the "seeAlso" annotation, containing the original URI. \nThis procedure allows querying, for example, for both "silvanus:Fire" and "envo:Fire" individuals \nwhile avoiding having to import everything from every ontology into the SILVANUS ontology. \nThis  way,  results  of  other  projects  are  reused,  and  the  SILVANUS  semantic  knowledge  base  is \ninteroperable  with  knowledge  bases  based  on  these  other  ontologies  because  there  are  loose \nconnections between the two models. \nThe following paragraphs will describe in more detail the selection process involved in each single \nontology considered for the SILVANUS ontology design. \n4.3.1 beAWARE \nThe beAWARE ontology is the ontology curated and suggested by Catalink. Many parts of it have \nbeen  reused  in  the  SILVANUS  ontology,  so  much  that  it  could  be  considered  the  SILVANUS \nontology starting base.  \nIt is of particular interest because, among other relevant things, it brings in the picture infrastructure \nand structures. Even though these elements may seem beyond the scope of preventing and fighting \nforest fires, wildfires may impact for example a road or an electrical power plant and break a chain \nof interdependencies that might affect the work of first responders or sensors. So, in our opinion, \nrepresenting knowledge about these areas brings added value. \n92 \nBeAWARE also can cover concepts related to first responders and rescue missions. The figure 36 \nbelow8 displays the respective concepts in the proposed ontology. First responders (class Responder) \nare  assigned  one  or  more  missions  (class  Mission),  which  in  turn  relate  to  incidents  that  involve \nparticipating entities (class Vulnerable Object). A mission is also characterized by start and end time, \nstatus, and mission priority.\n', 'content_font': 9, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

It is envisaged to work as a handbook that is ready for easy consultation by all \nthe project partners. To this end, different forms of visualization will be adopted: \n• Static HTML documentation (Powered by Live Owl Documentation Environment27) \no Available in the Silvanus website resources section  \n• Graphical visualization (for all users) \n• Tabular visualization (more detailed, meant for developers that are going to use the ontology \nfor their applications) \n• Protégé visualization (for those familiar with the ontology editing tool Protégé) \nTo  keep  the  deliverable  as  easy  to  navigate  as  possible,  only  the  graphical  visualization  will  be \nincluded inside the corpus, while the other two are available in the appendixes A and B. \n5.1 SILVANUS Semantic Model – Ontology \n5.1.1 Terminology unification \nTerminology (and thus knowledge) unification allows all parties to share each other’s knowledge, \nenables semantic interrogability and the result is a semantic model populated with input data that \ndelivers a unified view of available info to end user. Various app with different purposes can run on \ntop of such semantic model. \nWe  looked  for  the  main  concepts  mentioned  in  the  pilots,  used  in  pre-existing  ontologies  and \nsuggested by partners with domain expertise.  \nWe  gathered  all  the  different  concepts  in  one  spreadsheet  and  highlighted  them  using  different \ncolours for different macro-categories (Fire, Tool & resource, Cause, Climate, Biodiversity, Sensor, \nVulnerable object).  \nThe most similar concepts in each of these macro-categories have been listed near each other in \nanother spreadsheet and a single common class has been decided to represent them. \n5.1.2 Ontologies from scratch \nOntologies  can  be  created  to  describe  any  aspect  of  the  human  experience.  Before  setting  on  to \ncreate it, one should ask themselves some questions, for example what the scope of the ontology is, \nwho will use it, how will it be used. This will enable the creator to focus on the relevant entities and \nrelations. \nThen, once the required knowledge has been acquired, it needs to be conceptualized in a model that \ndescribes the problem and its solution.  \nThe next step is to implement this model in a formal language. This can be done using a description \nlogic representation system (such as the OWL language). \nFinally, the model needs to be evaluated with respect to its frame of reference.28 This process is \nexemplified in figure 37. \n", 'content_font': 6, 'heading_font': 12, 'source': 'D3.1.pdf'}

root - INFO - {'heading': 'The  first  step  in  creating  the  SILVANUS  ontology  was  represented  by  the  study  of  all  the \ninformation that was circulating at the time and try to organize it in a graphical schema where each \nconcept and field of knowledge was connected in a meaningful way. The first results of this activity \ncarried out on Miro (a digital whiteboard environment) were presented at the Zvolen workshop and \npartners have been invited to leave comments and feedback on it. \nIn the following weeks some feedback was received about certain classes and relationship and the \nsuggestions were implemented in the mockup ontology. \nFollowing this, the process of building the real ontology started, at first by establishing all the classes \nand  properties  proposed  in  the  mockup.  Once  this  phase  was  completed,  we  started  looking  for \npotential relations between classes (e.g.: “low moisture level” > “may cause” > fire). \nExternal  ontology  implementation  has  been  another  hurdle  to  figure  out:  importing  the  entire \nontology would pollute SILVANUS ontology with too many irrelevant classes and relationships. \nThanks to  Catalink,  we found out  that using the property “seeAlso”  we  can establish a soft link \nbetween  SILVANUS  ontology  and  the  third-party  ontology,  and  this  allows  for  interoperability \nbetween the SILVANUS system and a system based on this other ontology. \n5.1.5 Ontology Graphical Representation \nAs mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, there are different ways of representing an ontology. \nSome are more graphical and easier to understand but less detailed, some others are less graphical \nbut  more  detailed.  To  keep  the  deliverable  as  easy  to  consult  as  possible,  only  the  graphical \nvisualization  will  be  included  inside  the  corpus,  while  the  other  two  (tabular  and  Protégé \nvisualization) are available in the appendixes A and B. \n109 \nThe following section proposes a graphical representation of the ontology classes and relationships \nthat are included in the first version of the SILVANUS ontology. The representation was made using \nthe online tool Miro29, a platform for creating various kinds of flowcharts. \nFirst there will be a bird’s eye view representing all the macro-areas that compose the SILVANUS \nontology. Then, each macro-area will be showcased in greater detail. \nBefore proceeding with the visualization, a couple of conventions that have been used: \n• Classes  with  no  background  colour  are  old  classes  that  were  presented  for  the  version \npresented at the workshop in Zvolen.  \n• Classes with turquoise background are classes that have been added for the Bari workshop \nversion. \n• Classes with a yellow background are classes under consideration for change or deletion in \nthe future. \n• Straight lines represent a parent-child relationship (also known as “is a” relationship) \n• Dashed curved lines represent other kind of relationships (also known as properties) \n5.1.5.1 Bird’s eye view\nFigure 39 shows a bird’s eye view of the whole SILVANUS ontology. Immediately visible are the \nseven macro-areas that were identified in phase two: Fire, Cause, Biodiversity, Sensors, Tools & \nResources, Vulnerable Objects, Climate.

Combined with the SILVANUS KB Semantic Model, these components \nwill work in synchronise promoting an expansive, semantically linked view of the forest, from high \nlevel concepts and observations to the data objects and lineage that provide these insights. \nTo provide the context in which the Metadata Index will function as well as requirements, we first \nintroduce the SILVANUS Big-data Framework (BDF) component. The BDF is responsible for the \nstorage  and  analysis  of  heterogeneous  data  ingested  from  various  sources  throughout  the \nSILVANUS  platform.  The  goal  of  this  Framework  to  provide  inferences  via  deployed  machine \nlearnings models, e.g. fire spread and fire danger indices. Each model deployed will require varying \ninput datasets, dependant on different requirements such as spatial & temporal attributes or device \nand ingestion mechanism features. It is the objective of the Metadata Index to provide an expressive \nsearch mechanism / catalog over these data objects ingested and that are accessible to the ML models \ndeployed within SILVANUS. \nKey features that will define the Metadata Index semantic model: \n• Geospatial and temporal description \n• Cross-referencing (External KB, Event link) \n• Extensible model \n•\n• Access policies \nInternal & External data object references \n5.2.2 Component Overview \nThe main purpose of the Metadata Index is to serve as a searchable catalog of data objects held both \ninternally within the SILVANUS Big-data Framework storage solution, as well as references to data \nobjects  contained  within  external  repositories  (e.g.  Earth  Observation  datasets).  Through  an \nexpressive semantic model we aim to provide rich search / query functionality (e.g. return object(s) \nby geospatial coordinates + event + time). A key objective of this component includes the integration \nwith the SILVANUS Knowledge Base model allowing for cross-referenceable events, objects etc., \nfurther promoting an expansive search mechanism. The Metadata Index semantic model will also \nsupport us in implementing data lifecycle management and data privacy/access control via object \nlinked policy information, for use specifically within the Big-data Framework. \nThe Metadata Index is  a sub-component of the Storage Abstraction Layer and is responsible for \ncataloguing  all  data  objects  cached  in  the  SILVANUS  object  store,  as  well  as  certain  external \ndatasets available from third-party data hubs such a Copernicus. Via APIs exposed by the Storage \nAbstraction Layer SILVANUS services can search the Metadata Index for data objects they require \nto perform their analysis or display the previous results to end users. In addition, the Metadata Index \nmanages the access control and lifecycle of all objects in the object store, such deleting objects that \nhave passed the expiration data or issuing event messages when an object has been manipulated.      \nUnlike many conventional catalogues or metadata indexes, which use based on relational databases, \nthe  SILVANUS  Metadata  Index  is  implemented  as  an  RDF  semantic  graph,  similar  to  the \nSILVANUS Knowledge Base. Whereas the domain of interest for the Knowledge Base is forests \n132 \nand wildfires, the domain of interest for the Metadata Index is the structured and unstructured data \nobjects used by services in the SILVANUS system. So, to maintain a separation of concerns the \nKnowledge Base and Metadata Index are stored in separate semantic graphs; however, as they are \nbased  on  the  same  technology  that  supports  SPARQL  queries,  a  single  SPARQL  query  can  run \nacross both semantic graphs. The Metadata Index will be implemented using the opensource Jena \napplication encapsulated as a service, however it is fully encapsulated by the Storage Abstraction \nLayer and only exposed by APIs in the Storage Abstraction Layer. As with the Knowledge Base, \nand  RDF  semantic  graph  is  used  because  it  can  model  the  domain  data  in  a  more  flexible  and \nexpressive way. For example, new attributes, classes and relationships can be added dynamically \nwithout having to generate a new data access schema; in fact, RDF can support multiple data access \nschemas at the same time.   \nIn addition to the cached data objects and the external data object references, the Metadata Index \nalso models specific domain concepts that are utilized by the queries, such as a geospatial bounding \nbox around each SILVANUS pilot site. As most data objects will have a geospatial context, it is \npossible to ascertain if a specific object is contained or intersects with a pilot site. This information \nis  used  in  pre-processing  the  data,  such  as  cropping  the  data  to  the  pilot’s  bounding  box  or \ndetermining into which S3 bucket an object will be placed; if a data object has no geospatial context, \nit is placed in the General S3 bucket. \nThe types of metadata stored in the Metadata Index is quite diverse and may include information \nabout  an  object’s  a)  content  and  format;  b)  provenance  or  remote  reference;  c)  geospatial  and \ntemporal context; d) access rights and lifecycle; e) relationship to other objects; and f) attributes and \nannotations specific to the object and its source. For example, a UGV might capture an image of a \nfire in the forest. The location of the UGV and time the image was taken defines its geospatial and \ntemporal context, but additionally, the compass direction of the camera and its depth of view provide \nsupplementary  information  that  can  help  contextualise  where  the  fire  is.  The  core  entity  of  the \nMetadata Index is the data object, which has a globally unique identifier (GUID/UUID), generated \nby the Storage Abstraction Layer. Table 44 Metadata Index initial datapoint requirements contains \nthe initial set of metadata types associated to the data object under the classifications listed above. \nAdditional fields and relationships may be added in the future as required. \n5.2.3 Data Sources \nIn this section we detail each of the required data sources, formats and key metadata features for \nuse within the SILVANUS platform, this analysis presents some unique characteristics and drives \nthe investigation and decisions made for the Metadata Index ontology. \n5.2.3.1 Earth Observation \nEarth observation datasets are one of the more varied data sources that will be leveraged within the \nSILVANUS  Big  data/analytic  solution,  these  datasets  vary  in  size,  format  and  metadata \nspecification. Due to these data characteristics, we will detail each input dataset individually, and \nformalize the datasets providing based on the following attributes: \n1. Data source \n2. Data format  \n3. Ingestion Frequency \n4. Description \nThese attributes are important considerations to how the Metadata Index model is constructed to \nappropriately accommodate an expressive, semantically linked model for the cataloguing of earth \nobservation datasets. This model should also accommodate the description and indexing of datasets \nwhich are not currently stored within the SILVANUS Storage solution, this promotes a resource \nefficient method of retrieving datasets on-demand where possible.  Data provenance / lineage is also \n133 \na key modelling attribute related to  the Earth Observation Product  lifecycle within SILVANUS, \nwhich will describe the intermediary processing and relation to raw data assets while the dataset is \npresent within the SILVANUS Big-data framework.  \nSentinel Products \nData Source: Copernicus Open API Hub \nData Format: Compressed .SAFE – Image .JPG – Metadata .XML/JSON  \nIngestion Frequency: Dynamic \nDescription: This is a dynamic category of products offered through the ESA’s Copernicus Satellite \nmissions. This product can be viewed as a ‘top-level’ view of Sentinel services, specific datasets in \nthis  category  can  vary  depending  on  the  processing  requirement.  Different  types  of  data  can  be \nretrieved,  from  specific  image  frequency  bands,  terrain  and  height  maps  to  weather  and  climate \nrelated data. Product metadata retrieved in JSON format via a REST API request containing Product \nID.  This  retrieved  metadata  contains  a  range  of  useful  indexing  variables,  of  note  are  spatial \nfootprints / bounding box coordinate values, temporal and sensor values.  \nDigital Elevation Model \nData Source: Copernicus Land Services  \nData Format: Compressed .ZIP – Image .TIFF – Metadata .XML \nIngestion Frequency: Static \nDescription: This is a static dataset provided by Copernicus land services, describing the height / \nelevation for a region within Europe. Products split into tiles, which are ‘sections’ of land covered \nby  the  DEM.  Each  tile  has  a  metadata  descriptor  attached,  which  describes  the  region  /  spatial \ncontext, as well as other relevant indexing datapoints.  \nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index \nData Source: Copernicus Land Services  \nData Format: Compressed .ZIP – Image .TIFF – Metadata .XML\nIngestion Frequency: Dynamic – weekly  \nDescription: This product provides an indication of the “greenness” of a region, generally used for \nmonitoring  ecosystems.  This  product  is  computed  via  a  simple  formula  to  measure  the  spectral \nreflectance  from  near  infrared  and  red  wavebands  from  a  base  level  product,  generally  publicly \navailable datasets are derived from a sentinel-3 product.  \nLand Surface Temperature  \nData Source: Copernicus Land Services \nData Format: Compressed .ZIP – NetCDF .nc\nIngestion Frequency: Dynamic – hourly  \nDescription: This product gives an estimated surface and air temperature based on remote sensor \nreadings from a number of geostationary satellites. These readings are subject to relatively rapid \nchange based on several ground conditions,  therefor this is  one of the Products  requiring higher \ndynamic ingestion frequencies. \nBurnt Area \nData Source: Copernicus Land Services \nData Format: Compressed .ZIP – Image .TIFF – Metadata .XML\nIngestion Frequency: Dynamic – monthly  \nDescription: This product provides burn scar/burn area indicators, areas which have been affected \nby wildfires and have seen a significant change in the vegetation cover. These computed products \nare derived from Sentinel-3 and PROBA-V Products.  \nWeather \nData Source: EUMETSAT (via CMCC system) \nData Format: Variable by Product / Processing Level (NetCDF, BUFR, PNG) \nIngestion Frequency: Dynamic  \nDescription: This ingestion source covers a range of products offered by the EUMETSAT platform, \nthese  datasets  provide  access  to  a  range  of  earth  observation  related  datasets,  including  climate, \n134 \nweather,  atmosphere  and  ocean  products.  Specifically  relevant  to  the  Metadata  Index  we  will \ncatalogue weather & climate data, some of which may undergo some pre-processing within a partner \ndeployed weather cataloguing and analytics platform.    \n5.2.3.2 In-situ Devices \nFor the in-situ data collection devices, we consider two distinct ingestion modes which influence \nthe base Metadata Index model.   \nIoT Environmental Sensors \nThese devices collect environmental data such as temperature and gas readings, these datasets are \nrelevantly lightweight data sources. Contextual metadata (e.g., spatial, temporal data from \nthe sensor) will also be provided and ingested through the Storage Abstraction Layer. The \nMetadata Index model is responsible for providing a semantically link via metadata related \nto this device for indexing and later retrieval.  For consideration in relation to the metadata \nindex  \nIoT Camera Sensors \nCamera  sensors  data  source  formats  and  ingestion  frequency  will  likely  differ  from  the  Storage \nAbstraction Layer and ingestion perspective, in terms of frequency of ingestion (I.e. event \nor  stream  based  ingestion),  another  feature  will  be  the  data  format,  whereby  data  can  be \ningested as single images, a collection of images and finally a video file. With respect to the \nMetadata  Index  semantic  model,  we  only  consider  the  cataloguing  and  object  series  link \nrequirements to data objects produced by these devices. In this case we only need to consider \nthe key modelling attributes such as the spatial, temporal, object link and other key features \nthat may be indexed for later retrieval.  \n5.2.3.3 Weather & Climate  \nWeather and Climate datasets for use within the SILVANUS Big-data framework are another key \nsource of input for some deployed ML models. These datasets vary widely in temporal resolution \nand datapoints produced, based on location and availability of sensors. Generally, datasets in this \nsource category are formatted in NetCDF, HDF and GRIB. These are self-contained, portable files \nwhich also describe contextual metadata such as source location, date/time and a range of weather \nsensor readings. Weather and Climate based datasets produced at round weather stations will serve \nas  an  auxiliary  input  into  the  SILAVNUS  Big-data  framework,  with  EUMETSTAT  Products \nprimarily providing coverage for most required datapoints and regions.  \n5.2.3.4 Arial & Ground \nThis category of data source encompasses ingestion and description of data from drones and ground \nrobots deployed to  some pilot  sites. Datasets  catalogued from  this source will fall into a similar \ndescriptive  category  to  those  described  above.  Specific  data  sources  from  the  sensor  devices \ndeployed to these platforms include environmental data collected through sensors and visual data \ncollected from cameras. It is therefore envisaged that within the semantic model, minimal additional \nfeatures are needed. One key point for this category is the focus on a spatial-temporal linked data \nseries, allowing for the description and indexing of a datapoint based on a mission. This allows for \ndatapoints collected via to a specific drone flight or robot deployment are semantically linked, and \nthere for the data produced can be indexed and later retrieved.  \nAn important aspect for consideration with respect to the above input data sources, is the level of \ngranularity provided within the Metadata Index semantic model. This governs how expansive the \nindexing  /  search  process  will  be,  e.g.  will  the  model  accommodate  specific  dataset  values \n(temperature), approximations (avg. temperature) or only a high level view of data objects linked \nby spatial and temporal properties. This aspect will be detailed in the next section. \n135 \n5.2.4\nIndexing Requirements & Terms \nIn this section we detail an initial draft of the metadata key points produced from an analysis of each \ndata source category. We will use this as a set of baseline features that will be targeted within the \nMetadata Index semantic model.

root - INFO - {'heading': '138 \nThe DCAT specification also defines the implementation and extension of the vocabulary with the \nuse  of  key  vocabularies  for  a  more  expressive  and  specialized  catalogue  of  datasets.  These \nvocabulary extensions are outlined in two specific categories, Normative vocabularies are included \nas  part  of  the  standard  DCAT  model,  while  Non-normative  vocabularies  are  only  provided  as  a \nguideline for more specialized use cases and modelling requirements. Of interest to the Metadata \nIndex semantic model within these two categories are: \n– Normative: ODRL, OWL, DC PROV, RDF, RDFS, SKOS, TIME\n– Non-normative: w3cgeo, earl, geosparql,  \nThe  above  vocabularies  allow  for  an  extensible  model  for  a  variety  of  features  required  in  the \nMetadata Index semantic model. These normative vocabularies are widely used in a variety of model \nuse  cases  and  will  be  useful  in  further  expanding  the  scope  of  DCAT  where  applicable.  The \nfollowing    outlines  the  key  vocabularies  implemented  within  the  DCAT  ontology  and  their \napplication to the Metadata Index key features of interest. \nContent description: \nDC/DCT – Many of the base properties within the DCAT vocabulary reference The Dublin Core \nMetadata  Initiative  (DCMI)  ontology,  a  base  vocabulary  for  describing  resources.  Dublin  Core \nTerms is an extension of the DC vocabulary which further models the entity relationships between \nresources.  \nData provenance & Lineage: \nPROV-O  –  PROV-0  is  an  ontology  implementation  of  the  PROV  Data  Model,  a  model  for  the \ndescription of data movement including,  data origin,  data transformation  /  processes and related \nentities.  \nPolicy & Access Control: \nODRL: Open Digital Rights Language is a vocabulary which models the access rights and usage of \nentities. In our use case specifically this will allow for the definition of rule based data object access \ncontrol. \nTemporal modelling \nDCAT,  DCT:  DCAT  Implements  five  properties  for  temporal  data  modelling,  each  varying  on \nspecific data model features. The most basic properties of temporal data describe the date of creation \nfrequency \n(dcterms:issued), \nof  modification \ndate \n(dcterms:accrualPeriodicity).  We  may \nseparation \n(dcat:temporalResolution) as well as the temporal range (dcterms:temporal) of a dataset.

The objective of \nthis model integration is primarily to enhance the complimentary aspects, between the Knowledge \nBase model which represents the forest characteristics combined with the Metadata Index, which \ndescribes and indexes the data objects contained within the forest.  \nA key feature gained through semantically linking these two distinct data model ontologies is the \nability to provide a link between forest model facts contained within the Knowledge Base with data \nobject metadata and data access information. As an example of the functionality semantic linking \nbetween KB facts and data objects is the ability to link a fire detection event within the Knowledge \nBase to a) all related data objects for a specified geospatial region, b) a data object attributed to a \nfire detection event.  \n143 \nIn order to facilitate the above objective, through an analysis of semantic models to determine an \nappropriate cross-referencing mechanism, we have outlined preliminary class definition within the \ncontext of the Knowledge Base Sensor ontology. This class, Metadata Index Reference (MDI_REF) \nis  related  to  the  Dataset  class  within  the  Sensor  ontology,  each  Dataset  will  have  the  ability  to \nadditionally  accommodate  a  semantic  link  between  the  Knowledge  Base  and  Metadata  Index \nthrough this ‘MDI_REF’ relationship. This class relationship will provide a link to the Metadata \nIndex, the semantic link to the Metadata Index is implemented via a universally unique identifier \n(UUID) described by the MDI_REF.

root - INFO - {'heading': 'Deliverable 3.1 represents the outcome of the SILVANUS ontology design effort, which was the \nresult of a critical analysis of both existing technologies and a bottom-up listening methodology that \nallowed for the identification of SILVANUS-specific ontology classes. \nAt the time of submission of Deliverable 3.1, an initial version of the SILVANUS ontology  has \nbeen  designed,  with  the  aim  of  collecting  all  concepts  relevant  to  the  SILVANUS  project  and \nuniquely describing their meaning (semantics) and the relationships between these concepts.  \nThe paper walks through the various stages of the process that led to the design of the ontology. A \nfirst phase involved the collection and objective description of all the material reported in literature \nin terms of ontologies and taxonomies related to the topic of forest fires. This was followed by the \ncollection  of  relevant  information  extracted  from  the  analysis  of  internal  project  material,  pilot \ndescriptions, and deliverables written by partners in the early stages of the project.  \nIn the second phase of the deliverable, all the material described in the previous point is analyzed \nfor the purposes of the SILVANUS project, is categorized according to a methodology described in \ndetail, and choices are made according to widely described criteria with the aim of harmonizing the \ncollected knowledge.    \nFinally,  we  detail  the  Metadata  Index  ontology  with  reference  to  the  model  interoperability  and \nintegration  design  carried  out  between  the  SILVANUS  Knowledge  Base  and  Metadata  Index \nsemantic models. This work aims to support the semantic capabilities offered by the SILVANUS \nplatform,  through  the  offering  of  a  fact-based  model  representation  of  the  forest  environment \nsupported by a semantic link to the data objects that underpin these observations.  \nThe resulting ontology is described so that it can be a reference for all project partners. Everyone \nwill be able to consult the ontology in the way that suits them best. Just to simplify the consultation \nof the ontology, three different representations have been proposed:  \n• a graphical representation for non-expert users, which allows quick visualization of concepts \nand relationships  \n• a tabular representation for users who are interested in details  \n• an automatic representation provided by the ontology representation tool most widely used \nby ontology representation experts, Protégé. \nIt should be noted that to enable semantic interoperability, all SILVANUS project partners will need \nto consult and adhere to the proposed ontology by appropriately using the concepts and relationships \nit contains, both during the design and development phases of the tools and models created during \nthe project. The risk is that semantic references may be lost, and knowledge disharmonized.  \nThis ontology will be made public for the European union by the end of the project. Meanwhile, the \nlatest version can be downloaded on the Silvanus website resources section. \nAs the SILVANUS project and its products evolve in the months to come, the SILVANUS ontology \nwill evolve naturally along them. It will be updated, tweaked, and enhanced up until the end of Task \n3.1  in  2024  both  concepts-wise  and  relations-wise,  most  notably  following  the  near-future \ncollaboration with Catalink for Task 5.2 – Semantic fusion, as well as following adaptations and \nadjustments as required by project partners. \n145 \n7 References \n1.

5.1.5.7  Vulnerable Objects  
The Vulnerable object -related macro -area of the SILVANUS  ontology is meant to represent 
concepts and relationships related to vulnerable objects.  
The Vulnerable object class can be considered the “entry point” of this area of the ontology. It 
includes in its subclasses different kinds of vulnerable objects with their own subtypes.  Due to size 
constraints, its graphical representation in the deliverable has been split into top and bottom parts, 
shown in figures 49 and 50.

 various sensors of the framework. This information is fed to the ontology from the analysis 
components; the core constructs in the ontology are illustrated in figure  10. 
 
Figure 10 Representation of analyzed data in the beAWARE ontology8 
Class Media Item represents an item of analyzed data, which is related to some analysis task  
(via class Task). Media items can be pieces of text, images, videos, or social media posts, all  
of them submitted during the occurrence of the crisis. The analysis of the respective items  
(text analysis, image analysis or video analysis) produces a Dataset containing all relevant  
information (e.g., an object detection task may produce a dataset of detected incidents,  
objects, and confidence scores)  
The following figure  11 demonstrates an example of a video analysis instance, where a vehicle is 
detected participating in a flood incident. Note that the beAWARE ontology contains a complete 
typology of media items (text, image, video, social media), vulnerable objects (e.g ., assets, 
stakeholders, infrastructure, buildings etc.), impacts, data analyses, and incidents.  
 
Figure 11 A video analysis example in the beAWARE ontology.8 
3.2.1.3  Representing Rescue Team Assignments  
The third component of the beAWARE ontology is responsible for semantically representing  
rescue team assignments. This component is not very mature.  
The following figure  12 displays the respective concepts in the proposed ontology. First responders 
(class Responder) are assigned one or more missions (class Mission), which in turn relate to 
incidents that involve participating entities (class Vulnerable Object). A mission is also 
characterized by start and end time, status , and mission priority.

about measures and positions, needed across all datasets.  
• 6 forestry modules, used to describe the data of forest inventories and land cover maps. There 
are two general ontologies that provide broad concepts usable by any country (ifi -core and 
ilu-core), two ontologies that describe Spanish data (ifn -core and mfe -core), and two 
ontologies that describe Portuguese data (ifn -pt-core and cos -core).  
• An ontology for describing data about types of soil erosion (ines).  
• An ontology for the publication of data about Iberian Forest Fires Statistics (incendios -
forestales).  
This design has two main goals:  
1. Increase the reuse by external agents: each of the ontologies is easier to understand 
separately, and the separation makes it possible for any user to load the data they need, 
disregarding the rest. Additionally, since several ontologies and datasets exist for the
